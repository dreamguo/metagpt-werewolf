Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7', 'Player8', 'Player9', 'Player10'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Seer): 21 | Listen here, darling! I have some important news. I am the Seer, and I verified Player2's identity last night. Player2 is a werewolf! We need to come together and eliminate this threat before they can attack again. I understand that revealing my role might put a target on my back, but it's crucial for the survival of the villagers. Let's not waste this opportunity and vote to eliminate Player2!
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | Hey everyone! 🌟 I just want to say that Player1's sudden claim to be the Seer is a bit suspicious, don't you think? 🤔 We should be careful about jumping to conclusions! What if they are trying to mislead us? Let's not forget that we need to work together to find the real threats among us! 💪✨ I propose we take a closer look at other players before making any hasty decisions. Let's keep our eyes open and think strategically! 💖
Player3(Guard): 21 | I believe Player1's claim needs to be taken seriously, but I also have to be cautious of Player2's defense. I won't vote yet, as I want to gather more information before making a decision.
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | I believe Player1's claim is questionable. We should consider the possibility that they are trying to mislead us. Let's not rush into any decisions without further discussion. I suggest we focus on gathering more information before making a vote.
Player5(Werewolf): 21 | Yo fam, I gotta say, Player1's claim sounds a bit sus to me! 🤔 Like, how can we trust someone who just pops up outta nowhere claiming to be the Seer? We gotta keep our heads on straight and not let emotions cloud our judgment. Let's take a step back and think about this strategically. Player2 is just trying to defend themselves, and we should consider all possibilities before jumping to conclusions. Let's not rush into a vote without gathering more info, ya feel me? We need to work together and figure out who the real threats are! 💪✨
Player6(Werewolf): 21 | I think we should be cautious about Player1's claim. While they say they are the Seer, we must remember that anyone can claim any role in this game. Player2's defense seems genuine, and I believe we should investigate further before making any hasty decisions. Let's not rush into a vote without gathering more information about everyone else. We need to work together and ensure we are targeting the real threats among us.

                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Seer): 21 | Listen here, darling! I have some important news. I am the Seer, and I verified Player2's identity last night. Player2 is a werewolf! We need to come together and eliminate this threat before they can attack again. I understand that revealing my role might put a target on my back, but it's crucial for the survival of the villagers. Let's not waste this opportunity and vote to eliminate Player2!
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | Hey everyone! 🌟 I just want to say that Player1's sudden claim to be the Seer is a bit suspicious, don't you think? 🤔 We should be careful about jumping to conclusions! What if they are trying to mislead us? Let's not forget that we need to work together to find the real threats among us! 💪✨ I propose we take a closer look at other players before making any hasty decisions. Let's keep our eyes open and think strategically! 💖
Player3(Guard): 21 | I believe Player1's claim needs to be taken seriously, but I also have to be cautious of Player2's defense. I won't vote yet, as I want to gather more information before making a decision.
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | I believe Player1's claim is questionable. We should consider the possibility that they are trying to mislead us. Let's not rush into any decisions without further discussion. I suggest we focus on gathering more information before making a vote.
Player5(Werewolf): 21 | Yo fam, I gotta say, Player1's claim sounds a bit sus to me! 🤔 Like, how can we trust someone who just pops up outta nowhere claiming to be the Seer? We gotta keep our heads on straight and not let emotions cloud our judgment. Let's take a step back and think about this strategically. Player2 is just trying to defend themselves, and we should consider all possibilities before jumping to conclusions. Let's not rush into a vote without gathering more info, ya feel me? We need to work together and figure out who the real threats are! 💪✨
Player6(Werewolf): 21 | I think we should be cautious about Player1's claim. While they say they are the Seer, we must remember that anyone can claim any role in this game. Player2's defense seems genuine, and I believe we should investigate further before making any hasty decisions. Let's not rush into a vote without gathering more information about everyone else. We need to work together and ensure we are targeting the real threats among us.

Moderator(Moderator): 38 | Witch, you also have a bottle of poison, would you like to use it to kill one of the living players?
                   Choose one from the following living options: ['Player1', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7', 'Player8', 'Player9', 'Player10'].
                   If so, say ONLY "Poison PlayerX", replace PlayerX with the actual player name, else, say "Pass".

Moderator(Moderator): 40 | Witch, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 41 | Seer, please open your eyes!
Moderator(Moderator): 42 | Seer, you can check one player's identity. Who are you going to verify its identity tonight?
                    Choose only one from the following living options:['Player1', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7', 'Player8', 'Player9', 'Player10'].
Player1(Seer): 42 | Verify Player3
Moderator(Moderator): 43 | Player3 is a good guy
Moderator(Moderator): 44 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 45 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 46 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 47 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7', 'Player8', 'Player9', 'Player10'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Seer): 47 | Listen up, everyone! As the Seer, I have verified Player2 as a werewolf, and they have been eliminated. This proves my role, and I urge you all to trust my judgment. We need to focus on the remaining players and identify any suspicious behavior. Player3 has shown support for my claim, while others have been more skeptical. Let's discuss our next steps carefully and work together to eliminate any remaining threats. Remember, we are all on the same side, and communication is key to our survival!
Player3(Guard): 47 | Protect Player1
Player4(Werewolf): 47 | I believe we should be cautious about blindly trusting Player1's claim as the Seer. While they did eliminate Player2, we must consider the possibility of deception. Let's not rush into decisions without further discussion. I suggest we take a closer look at Player3's support for Player1 and evaluate their motives. We need to gather more information before making any hasty votes.
Player5(Werewolf): 47 | Yo fam, I gotta say, Player1's claim is looking a bit shaky! 🤔 We can't just take their word for it, right? Like, how do we know they aren't just trying to play us? We gotta keep our heads on straight and think strategically. Player3 is backing Player1, but we need to investigate further before making any hasty decisions. Let's not rush into a vote without gathering more info, ya feel me? We need to work together and figure out who the real threats are! 💪✨
Player6(Werewolf): 47 | I think we should be cautious about blindly trusting Player1's claim as the Seer. While they eliminated Player2, we must consider the possibility of deception. Let's not rush into decisions without further discussion. I suggest we take a closer look at Player3's support for Player1 and evaluate their motives. We need to gather more information before making any hasty votes.

Player1(Seer): 21 | Listen here, darling! I have some important news. I am the Seer, and I verified Player2's identity last night. Player2 is a werewolf! We need to come together and eliminate this threat before they can attack again. I understand that revealing my role might put a target on my back, but it's crucial for the survival of the villagers. Let's not waste this opportunity and vote to eliminate Player2!
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | Hey everyone! 🌟 I just want to say that Player1's sudden claim to be the Seer is a bit suspicious, don't you think? 🤔 We should be careful about jumping to conclusions! What if they are trying to mislead us? Let's not forget that we need to work together to find the real threats among us! 💪✨ I propose we take a closer look at other players before making any hasty decisions. Let's keep our eyes open and think strategically! 💖
Player3(Guard): 21 | I believe Player1's claim needs to be taken seriously, but I also have to be cautious of Player2's defense. I won't vote yet, as I want to gather more information before making a decision.
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | I believe Player1's claim is questionable. We should consider the possibility that they are trying to mislead us. Let's not rush into any decisions without further discussion. I suggest we focus on gathering more information before making a vote.
Player5(Werewolf): 21 | Yo fam, I gotta say, Player1's claim sounds a bit sus to me! 🤔 Like, how can we trust someone who just pops up outta nowhere claiming to be the Seer? We gotta keep our heads on straight and not let emotions cloud our judgment. Let's take a step back and think about this strategically. Player2 is just trying to defend themselves, and we should consider all possibilities before jumping to conclusions. Let's not rush into a vote without gathering more info, ya feel me? We need to work together and figure out who the real threats are! 💪✨
Player6(Werewolf): 21 | I think we should be cautious about Player1's claim. While they say they are the Seer, we must remember that anyone can claim any role in this game. Player2's defense seems genuine, and I believe we should investigate further before making any hasty decisions. Let's not rush into a vote without gathering more information about everyone else. We need to work together and ensure we are targeting the real threats among us.

                   Choose one from the following living options: ['Player1', 'Player3', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7', 'Player8', 'Player9', 'Player10'].
                   If so, say ONLY "Poison PlayerX", replace PlayerX with the actual player name, else, say "Pass".

Moderator(Moderator): 66 | Witch, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 67 | Seer, please open your eyes!
Moderator(Moderator): 68 | Seer, you can check one player's identity. Who are you going to verify its identity tonight?
                    Choose only one from the following living options:['Player1', 'Player3', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7', 'Player8', 'Player9', 'Player10'].
Player1(Seer): 68 | Verify Player5
Moderator(Moderator): 69 | Player5 is a werewolf
Moderator(Moderator): 70 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 71 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 72 | ['Player5'] was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 73 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player3', 'Player6', 'Player7', 'Player8', 'Player9', 'Player10'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Seer): 73 | Listen up, everyone! As the Seer, I can confirm that Player5 was a werewolf, and they have been eliminated. This proves my role, and I urge you all to trust my judgment. We need to focus on the remaining players and identify any suspicious behavior. Player3 has shown support for my claim, while others have been more skeptical. Let's discuss our next steps carefully and work together to eliminate any remaining threats. Remember, we are all on the same side, and communication is key to our survival!
Player3(Guard): 73 | I vote to eliminate Player6
Player6(Werewolf): 73 | Player1, while I respect your claim as the Seer, I find it concerning that you are so quick to eliminate players without thorough investigation. Player3's unwavering support for you raises questions about their motives. We must be cautious and not let emotions cloud our judgment. I suggest we take a closer look at Player3 before making any decisions. Let's discuss this further to ensure we are making the right choice.
Player7(Witch): 73 | I vote to eliminate Player6
Player8(Villager): 73 | I vote to eliminate Player6
Player9(Villager): 73 | I vote to eliminate Player6
Player10(Villager): 73 | I vote to eliminate Player6
