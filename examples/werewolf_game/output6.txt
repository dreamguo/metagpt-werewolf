Moderator(Moderator): 17 | Player10 is a good guy
Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7', 'Player8', 'Player9', 'Player10', 'Player11'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Werewolf): 21 | Wow! It's daytime and no one got eliminated last night, huh? Sheesh! We gotta keep our eyes peeled, fam. I mean, look at Player3, Player5, and Player6, they haven't said much yet. Ugh, feels like they're hiding something. Let's keep the pressure on them, yeah? I say we focus on those who are quiet, they might be trying to fly under the radar. Good God, we can't let them get away with it! What do you all think?
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | Eh fam, I feel like we should keep an eye on those who ain't talking much, like Player3 and Player6. They could be trying to blend in, you know? But wow, Player1 is right, we gotta keep the pressure on. Let's not let anyone slide under the radar, good God! We need to figure out who's who before it gets too late. Steady pom pi pi, let's chat more and see what everyone thinks, yeah?
Player3(Villager): 21 | Oh my! It's great that no one was eliminated last night, but we can't let our guard down, fam. I agree with Player1 and Player2 about keeping an eye on those who are quiet, especially Player6. They seem a bit defensive, and that could be a sign they're trying to deflect attention. Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can draw out any more information. We need to work together to figure out who the werewolves are before it's too late. Good God, let's stay sharp!
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | Oh my! It's interesting that no one got eliminated last night, right? Sheesh! I think we should definitely keep an eye on those who are being quiet, like Player6 and Player3. They seem to be trying to avoid the spotlight, and that could be a red flag, fam. Let's keep the conversation flowing and see if we can draw out more info from them. Good God, we can't let anyone slip under the radar! What do you all think?
Player5(Villager): 21 | Wow! It's great that no one got eliminated last night, but we can't let our guard down, fam. I agree with the others about keeping an eye on Player6. They’ve been pretty quiet, and that could be a sign they’re trying to blend in. Good God! We need to keep the pressure on and draw out more information. Let’s keep talking and see if we can figure out who the werewolves are before it’s too late! What do you all think?
Player6(Witch): 21 | Oh my! It's interesting how everyone is focusing on the quieter players, especially me. But let's not forget that Player1 is really pushing the narrative here, and that could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves. I mean, we gotta stay sharp, fam! I think we should keep the conversation flowing and not just target the quiet ones. Let's analyze this objectively, yeah? Good God, we need to figure out who the werewolves are before it’s too late! What do you all think?
Player7(Werewolf): 21 | Oh my! It's interesting how everyone is focusing on the quieter players, especially Player6. But let's not forget that Player1 is really pushing the narrative here, and that could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves. I mean, we gotta stay sharp, fam! I think we should keep the conversation flowing and not just target the quiet ones. Let's analyze this objectively, yeah? Good God, we need to figure out who the werewolves are before it’s too late! What do you all think?
Player8(Villager): 21 | Oh my! It's interesting that no one got eliminated last night, right? Sheesh! I feel like we should keep an eye on those who are being quieter, but we also need to watch out for those who are pushing the narrative too hard, like Player1. Good God, let's keep the conversation flowing and see if we can draw out more info from everyone. We can't let anyone slip under the radar! What do you all think?
Player9(Guard): 21 | Wow! It's a relief that no one got eliminated last night, but we can't let our guard down, fam. I see a lot of chatter about Player6 being quiet, but let’s not forget Player1 is really pushing for attention on them. That could be a tactic to deflect suspicion from themselves. Good God, we need to keep the conversation going and see if we can draw out more info from everyone. Let's stay sharp and figure out who the werewolves are before it's too late!

                    Choose only one from the following living options:['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7', 'Player8', 'Player9', 'Player10', 'Player11'].
Player11(Seer): 16 | Verify Player10
Moderator(Moderator): 17 | Player10 is a good guy
Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7', 'Player8', 'Player9', 'Player10', 'Player11'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Werewolf): 21 | Wow! It's daytime and no one got eliminated last night, huh? Sheesh! We gotta keep our eyes peeled, fam. I mean, look at Player3, Player5, and Player6, they haven't said much yet. Ugh, feels like they're hiding something. Let's keep the pressure on them, yeah? I say we focus on those who are quiet, they might be trying to fly under the radar. Good God, we can't let them get away with it! What do you all think?
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | Eh fam, I feel like we should keep an eye on those who ain't talking much, like Player3 and Player6. They could be trying to blend in, you know? But wow, Player1 is right, we gotta keep the pressure on. Let's not let anyone slide under the radar, good God! We need to figure out who's who before it gets too late. Steady pom pi pi, let's chat more and see what everyone thinks, yeah?
Player3(Villager): 21 | Oh my! It's great that no one was eliminated last night, but we can't let our guard down, fam. I agree with Player1 and Player2 about keeping an eye on those who are quiet, especially Player6. They seem a bit defensive, and that could be a sign they're trying to deflect attention. Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can draw out any more information. We need to work together to figure out who the werewolves are before it's too late. Good God, let's stay sharp!
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | Oh my! It's interesting that no one got eliminated last night, right? Sheesh! I think we should definitely keep an eye on those who are being quiet, like Player6 and Player3. They seem to be trying to avoid the spotlight, and that could be a red flag, fam. Let's keep the conversation flowing and see if we can draw out more info from them. Good God, we can't let anyone slip under the radar! What do you all think?
Player5(Villager): 21 | Wow! It's great that no one got eliminated last night, but we can't let our guard down, fam. I agree with the others about keeping an eye on Player6. They’ve been pretty quiet, and that could be a sign they’re trying to blend in. Good God! We need to keep the pressure on and draw out more information. Let’s keep talking and see if we can figure out who the werewolves are before it’s too late! What do you all think?
Player6(Witch): 21 | Oh my! It's interesting how everyone is focusing on the quieter players, especially me. But let's not forget that Player1 is really pushing the narrative here, and that could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves. I mean, we gotta stay sharp, fam! I think we should keep the conversation flowing and not just target the quiet ones. Let's analyze this objectively, yeah? Good God, we need to figure out who the werewolves are before it’s too late! What do you all think?
Player7(Werewolf): 21 | Oh my! It's interesting how everyone is focusing on the quieter players, especially Player6. But let's not forget that Player1 is really pushing the narrative here, and that could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves. I mean, we gotta stay sharp, fam! I think we should keep the conversation flowing and not just target the quiet ones. Let's analyze this objectively, yeah? Good God, we need to figure out who the werewolves are before it’s too late! What do you all think?
Player8(Villager): 21 | Oh my! It's interesting that no one got eliminated last night, right? Sheesh! I feel like we should keep an eye on those who are being quieter, but we also need to watch out for those who are pushing the narrative too hard, like Player1. Good God, let's keep the conversation flowing and see if we can draw out more info from everyone. We can't let anyone slip under the radar! What do you all think?
Player9(Guard): 21 | Wow! It's a relief that no one got eliminated last night, but we can't let our guard down, fam. I see a lot of chatter about Player6 being quiet, but let’s not forget Player1 is really pushing for attention on them. That could be a tactic to deflect suspicion from themselves. Good God, we need to keep the conversation going and see if we can draw out more info from everyone. Let's stay sharp and figure out who the werewolves are before it's too late!

Player3(Villager): 46 | Oh my! We lost Player6 last night, and that’s a bummer. But we need to keep our eyes on those who are pushing the narrative too hard, like Player2 and Player4.

I vote to eliminate Player2.
Player4(Werewolf): 46 | Oh my! It's a tough spot we're in, fam. I mean, Player3 is really pushing hard against Player2 and me, and that feels a bit off. We should definitely keep an eye on them.

Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7', 'Player8', 'Player9', 'Player10', 'Player11'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Werewolf): 21 | Wow! It's daytime and no one got eliminated last night, huh? Sheesh! We gotta keep our eyes peeled, fam. I mean, look at Player3, Player5, and Player6, they haven't said much yet. Ugh, feels like they're hiding something. Let's keep the pressure on them, yeah? I say we focus on those who are quiet, they might be trying to fly under the radar. Good God, we can't let them get away with it! What do you all think?
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | Eh fam, I feel like we should keep an eye on those who ain't talking much, like Player3 and Player6. They could be trying to blend in, you know? But wow, Player1 is right, we gotta keep the pressure on. Let's not let anyone slide under the radar, good God! We need to figure out who's who before it gets too late. Steady pom pi pi, let's chat more and see what everyone thinks, yeah?
Player3(Villager): 21 | Oh my! It's great that no one was eliminated last night, but we can't let our guard down, fam. I agree with Player1 and Player2 about keeping an eye on those who are quiet, especially Player6. They seem a bit defensive, and that could be a sign they're trying to deflect attention. Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can draw out any more information. We need to work together to figure out who the werewolves are before it's too late. Good God, let's stay sharp!
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | Oh my! It's interesting that no one got eliminated last night, right? Sheesh! I think we should definitely keep an eye on those who are being quiet, like Player6 and Player3. They seem to be trying to avoid the spotlight, and that could be a red flag, fam. Let's keep the conversation flowing and see if we can draw out more info from them. Good God, we can't let anyone slip under the radar! What do you all think?
Player5(Villager): 21 | Wow! It's great that no one got eliminated last night, but we can't let our guard down, fam. I agree with the others about keeping an eye on Player6. They’ve been pretty quiet, and that could be a sign they’re trying to blend in. Good God! We need to keep the pressure on and draw out more information. Let’s keep talking and see if we can figure out who the werewolves are before it’s too late! What do you all think?
Player6(Witch): 21 | Oh my! It's interesting how everyone is focusing on the quieter players, especially me. But let's not forget that Player1 is really pushing the narrative here, and that could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves. I mean, we gotta stay sharp, fam! I think we should keep the conversation flowing and not just target the quiet ones. Let's analyze this objectively, yeah? Good God, we need to figure out who the werewolves are before it’s too late! What do you all think?
Player7(Werewolf): 21 | Oh my! It's interesting how everyone is focusing on the quieter players, especially Player6. But let's not forget that Player1 is really pushing the narrative here, and that could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves. I mean, we gotta stay sharp, fam! I think we should keep the conversation flowing and not just target the quiet ones. Let's analyze this objectively, yeah? Good God, we need to figure out who the werewolves are before it’s too late! What do you all think?
Player8(Villager): 21 | Oh my! It's interesting that no one got eliminated last night, right? Sheesh! I feel like we should keep an eye on those who are being quieter, but we also need to watch out for those who are pushing the narrative too hard, like Player1. Good God, let's keep the conversation flowing and see if we can draw out more info from everyone. We can't let anyone slip under the radar! What do you all think?
Player9(Guard): 21 | Wow! It's a relief that no one got eliminated last night, but we can't let our guard down, fam. I see a lot of chatter about Player6 being quiet, but let’s not forget Player1 is really pushing for attention on them. That could be a tactic to deflect suspicion from themselves. Good God, we need to keep the conversation going and see if we can draw out more info from everyone. Let's stay sharp and figure out who the werewolves are before it's too late!

Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7', 'Player8', 'Player9', 'Player10', 'Player11'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Werewolf): 21 | Wow! It's daytime and no one got eliminated last night, huh? Sheesh! We gotta keep our eyes peeled, fam. I mean, look at Player3, Player5, and Player6, they haven't said much yet. Ugh, feels like they're hiding something. Let's keep the pressure on them, yeah? I say we focus on those who are quiet, they might be trying to fly under the radar. Good God, we can't let them get away with it! What do you all think?
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | Eh fam, I feel like we should keep an eye on those who ain't talking much, like Player3 and Player6. They could be trying to blend in, you know? But wow, Player1 is right, we gotta keep the pressure on. Let's not let anyone slide under the radar, good God! We need to figure out who's who before it gets too late. Steady pom pi pi, let's chat more and see what everyone thinks, yeah?
Player3(Villager): 21 | Oh my! It's great that no one was eliminated last night, but we can't let our guard down, fam. I agree with Player1 and Player2 about keeping an eye on those who are quiet, especially Player6. They seem a bit defensive, and that could be a sign they're trying to deflect attention. Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can draw out any more information. We need to work together to figure out who the werewolves are before it's too late. Good God, let's stay sharp!
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | Oh my! It's interesting that no one got eliminated last night, right? Sheesh! I think we should definitely keep an eye on those who are being quiet, like Player6 and Player3. They seem to be trying to avoid the spotlight, and that could be a red flag, fam. Let's keep the conversation flowing and see if we can draw out more info from them. Good God, we can't let anyone slip under the radar! What do you all think?
Player5(Villager): 21 | Wow! It's great that no one got eliminated last night, but we can't let our guard down, fam. I agree with the others about keeping an eye on Player6. They’ve been pretty quiet, and that could be a sign they’re trying to blend in. Good God! We need to keep the pressure on and draw out more information. Let’s keep talking and see if we can figure out who the werewolves are before it’s too late! What do you all think?
Player6(Witch): 21 | Oh my! It's interesting how everyone is focusing on the quieter players, especially me. But let's not forget that Player1 is really pushing the narrative here, and that could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves. I mean, we gotta stay sharp, fam! I think we should keep the conversation flowing and not just target the quiet ones. Let's analyze this objectively, yeah? Good God, we need to figure out who the werewolves are before it’s too late! What do you all think?
Player7(Werewolf): 21 | Oh my! It's interesting how everyone is focusing on the quieter players, especially Player6. But let's not forget that Player1 is really pushing the narrative here, and that could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves. I mean, we gotta stay sharp, fam! I think we should keep the conversation flowing and not just target the quiet ones. Let's analyze this objectively, yeah? Good God, we need to figure out who the werewolves are before it’s too late! What do you all think?
Player8(Villager): 21 | Oh my! It's interesting that no one got eliminated last night, right? Sheesh! I feel like we should keep an eye on those who are being quieter, but we also need to watch out for those who are pushing the narrative too hard, like Player1. Good God, let's keep the conversation flowing and see if we can draw out more info from everyone. We can't let anyone slip under the radar! What do you all think?
Player9(Guard): 21 | Wow! It's a relief that no one got eliminated last night, but we can't let our guard down, fam. I see a lot of chatter about Player6 being quiet, but let’s not forget Player1 is really pushing for attention on them. That could be a tactic to deflect suspicion from themselves. Good God, we need to keep the conversation going and see if we can draw out more info from everyone. Let's stay sharp and figure out who the werewolves are before it's too late!

Player3(Villager): 46 | Oh my! We lost Player6 last night, and that’s a bummer. But we need to keep our eyes on those who are pushing the narrative too hard, like Player2 and Player4. I feel like we should focus on the players who are trying to blend in and not just the quiet ones. Good God, let’s keep the conversation flowing and see if we can draw out more info from everyone. I vote to eliminate Player2.
Player4(Werewolf): 46 | Oh my! It's a tough spot we're in, fam. I mean, Player3 is really pushing hard against Player2 and me, and that feels a bit off. We should definitely keep an eye on them. But also, Player5 is just sitting back without much to say, which is kinda suspicious too. Good God! I say we focus on Player3 for now. I vote to eliminate Player3.
