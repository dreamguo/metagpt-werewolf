                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Villager): 21 | I believe we should discuss our observations and suspicions to identify any potential werewolves among us. As a villager, I am here to support the team and help eliminate the threats. Let's share our thoughts and work together to make an informed decision.
Player2(Witch): 21 | I believe we should all share our observations and suspicions to identify any potential werewolves among us. As the Witch, I saved Player2 last night, which means they are alive and can help us. I think it’s crucial to work together and discuss our thoughts openly. I urge everyone to share their insights so we can make an informed decision.
Player3(Seer): 21 | I believe we should continue discussing our observations. I urge everyone to share their thoughts so we can identify any potential werewolves among us.
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | I believe we should focus on gathering more information before making any decisions. Player2's claim as the Witch raises some questions, and I think we should analyze their actions further. Let's discuss our thoughts openly and see if we can identify any inconsistencies in what others are saying. I urge everyone to share their observations so we can work together effectively.
Player5(Guard): 21 | I believe we should carefully analyze Player2's claim as the Witch and gather more information before making any decisions. I will not reveal my identity yet, as it may put me at risk. Let's continue discussing our observations and work together to identify any potential werewolves among us.
Player6(Villager): 21 | I believe we should focus on Player2's claim as the Witch. While it could be true, we need to verify it through discussion. I urge everyone to share their observations and suspicions openly. As a Villager, I am here to support our team in identifying the werewolves. Let's work together to gather more information and make an informed decision.
Player7(Werewolf): 21 | I believe we need to be cautious about Player2's claim as the Witch. While they say they saved themselves, we should consider the possibility that this is a strategy to mislead us. I suggest we gather more information before making any decisions. Let's discuss our observations and see if we can identify any inconsistencies in Player2's story.

                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Villager): 21 | I believe we should discuss our observations and suspicions to identify any potential werewolves among us. As a villager, I am here to support the team and help eliminate the threats. Let's share our thoughts and work together to make an informed decision.
Player2(Witch): 21 | I believe we should all share our observations and suspicions to identify any potential werewolves among us. As the Witch, I saved Player2 last night, which means they are alive and can help us. I think it’s crucial to work together and discuss our thoughts openly. I urge everyone to share their insights so we can make an informed decision.
Player3(Seer): 21 | I believe we should continue discussing our observations. I urge everyone to share their thoughts so we can identify any potential werewolves among us.
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | I believe we should focus on gathering more information before making any decisions. Player2's claim as the Witch raises some questions, and I think we should analyze their actions further. Let's discuss our thoughts openly and see if we can identify any inconsistencies in what others are saying. I urge everyone to share their observations so we can work together effectively.
Player5(Guard): 21 | I believe we should carefully analyze Player2's claim as the Witch and gather more information before making any decisions. I will not reveal my identity yet, as it may put me at risk. Let's continue discussing our observations and work together to identify any potential werewolves among us.
Player6(Villager): 21 | I believe we should focus on Player2's claim as the Witch. While it could be true, we need to verify it through discussion. I urge everyone to share their observations and suspicions openly. As a Villager, I am here to support our team in identifying the werewolves. Let's work together to gather more information and make an informed decision.
Player7(Werewolf): 21 | I believe we need to be cautious about Player2's claim as the Witch. While they say they saved themselves, we should consider the possibility that this is a strategy to mislead us. I suggest we gather more information before making any decisions. Let's discuss our observations and see if we can identify any inconsistencies in Player2's story.

                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Villager): 21 | I believe we should discuss our observations and suspicions to identify any potential werewolves among us. As a villager, I am here to support the team and help eliminate the threats. Let's share our thoughts and work together to make an informed decision.
Player2(Witch): 21 | I believe we should all share our observations and suspicions to identify any potential werewolves among us. As the Witch, I saved Player2 last night, which means they are alive and can help us. I think it’s crucial to work together and discuss our thoughts openly. I urge everyone to share their insights so we can make an informed decision.
Player3(Seer): 21 | I believe we should continue discussing our observations. I urge everyone to share their thoughts so we can identify any potential werewolves among us.
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | I believe we should focus on gathering more information before making any decisions. Player2's claim as the Witch raises some questions, and I think we should analyze their actions further. Let's discuss our thoughts openly and see if we can identify any inconsistencies in what others are saying. I urge everyone to share their observations so we can work together effectively.
Player5(Guard): 21 | I believe we should carefully analyze Player2's claim as the Witch and gather more information before making any decisions. I will not reveal my identity yet, as it may put me at risk. Let's continue discussing our observations and work together to identify any potential werewolves among us.
Player6(Villager): 21 | I believe we should focus on Player2's claim as the Witch. While it could be true, we need to verify it through discussion. I urge everyone to share their observations and suspicions openly. As a Villager, I am here to support our team in identifying the werewolves. Let's work together to gather more information and make an informed decision.
Player7(Werewolf): 21 | I believe we need to be cautious about Player2's claim as the Witch. While they say they saved themselves, we should consider the possibility that this is a strategy to mislead us. I suggest we gather more information before making any decisions. Let's discuss our observations and see if we can identify any inconsistencies in Player2's story.
