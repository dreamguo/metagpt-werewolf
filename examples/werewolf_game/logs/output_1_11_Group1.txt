    "RESPONSE": "Yo, real talk, losing Player1 is a serious wake-up call for all of us. We gotta keep our eyes peeled, fam. Player3 is acting super defensive, and that’s kinda sus, don’t you think? Like, why so jumpy, my dude? Player4 is also being cautious, which could be a strategy to blend in. We need to keep the convo flowing and figure out who’s really on our side before it’s too late. Let’s stay sharp and see who slips up. For real, we can’t let the werewolves take us out one by one!"

                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, fam, we just lost Player1, and honestly, it’s getting real out here. Like, I’m feeling some sus vibes from Player3 and Player4, but tbh, we gotta keep our eyes peeled on everyone. I mean, no cap, we need to play it smart and not give ourselves away. Real talk, let’s keep the focus on the villagers, yeah? We can’t let them catch on to us. So, who’s feeling a bit off? I’m just saying, we should keep our options open.
Player3(Villager): 21 | Ayo, so we just lost Player1, and that’s a major bummer, fam. Like, we gotta be on our A-game now. Player2 seems pretty chill, but I’m lowkey side-eyeing Player4 and Player6 since they’re kinda quiet. You know how it goes, silence can be a red flag. We need to keep it real and figure out who’s who before they take us out next. Let’s keep the convo flowing and see who’s acting a bit off, alright? We can’t let the werewolves sneak by us. Stay sharp, everyone!
Player4(Witch): 21 | Ayo, real talk, we just lost Player1, and it’s a bit sus out here. Player2 seems to be on the right track, but Player3’s defensiveness is kinda raising eyebrows. Like, we gotta figure out who’s who before it’s too late. I’m not gonna reveal my identity just yet, but I’m watching everyone closely. Let’s keep the convo going and see who slips up. We can’t let the werewolves take us out one by one. Stay sharp, fam!
Player5(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, real talk, losing Player1 is a major wake-up call for us. I mean, we gotta keep our heads in the game, right? Player2 is throwing out some vibes, but honestly, I’m feeling like Player3 is a bit too defensive. Like, why so jumpy, my guy? We need to keep the spotlight off us and figure out who’s really sus. I’m not about to reveal my identity just yet, but we should definitely keep an eye on those acting a bit too chill. Let’s keep the convo flowing and see who slips up, fam!
Player6(Seer): 21 | Yo, fam, we lost Player1, and it’s a serious wake-up call. Player3 is acting kinda defensive, which is raising some red flags for me. Like, why so jumpy, my dude? Player4 is also being super cautious, and that’s a bit sus too. We gotta keep our eyes peeled and figure out who’s really on our side. I’m not ready to reveal my identity just yet, but I’m definitely keeping an eye on Player3 and Player4. We can’t let the werewolves take us out one by one, so let’s keep the convo going and see who slips up. Stay sharp, everyone!
Player7(Guard): 21 | Yo, real talk, losing Player1 is a major wake-up call for all of us. I mean, we gotta stay sharp and not let the werewolves play us like pawns. Player2's got some solid vibes going, but I'm keeping my eyes on Player3 and Player4 since they're acting a bit too cautious. Like, I get it, we all wanna survive, but we can't let that silence turn into a red flag. For real, let's keep the convo flowing and see who slips up. We gotta figure out who's really on our side before it's too late. Stay alert, fam!
Player8(Villager): 21 | Yo, fam, losing Player1 is a serious wake-up call, and we gotta stay sharp. Player3's defensiveness is definitely sus, but I’m not ready to point fingers just yet. I mean, we need to keep the convo flowing and see who else is acting a bit off. Player4 seems cautious, which could be a strategy to blend in, but we can't let that slide. Let’s keep our eyes peeled and figure out who’s really on our side. We can’t let the werewolves take us out one by one, so let’s keep the discussions alive and see who slips up. Stay alert, everyone!
Player9(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, real talk, losing Player1 is a serious wake-up call for all of us. We gotta keep our eyes peeled, fam. Player3 is acting super defensive, and that’s kinda sus, don’t you think? Like, why so jumpy, my dude? Player4 is also being cautious, which could be a strategy to blend in. We need to keep the convo flowing and figure out who’s really on our side before it’s too late. Let’s stay sharp and see who slips up. For real, we can’t let the werewolves take us out one by one!

                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, fam, we just lost Player1, and honestly, it’s getting real out here. Like, I’m feeling some sus vibes from Player3 and Player4, but tbh, we gotta keep our eyes peeled on everyone. I mean, no cap, we need to play it smart and not give ourselves away. Real talk, let’s keep the focus on the villagers, yeah? We can’t let them catch on to us. So, who’s feeling a bit off? I’m just saying, we should keep our options open.
Player3(Villager): 21 | Ayo, so we just lost Player1, and that’s a major bummer, fam. Like, we gotta be on our A-game now. Player2 seems pretty chill, but I’m lowkey side-eyeing Player4 and Player6 since they’re kinda quiet. You know how it goes, silence can be a red flag. We need to keep it real and figure out who’s who before they take us out next. Let’s keep the convo flowing and see who’s acting a bit off, alright? We can’t let the werewolves sneak by us. Stay sharp, everyone!
Player4(Witch): 21 | Ayo, real talk, we just lost Player1, and it’s a bit sus out here. Player2 seems to be on the right track, but Player3’s defensiveness is kinda raising eyebrows. Like, we gotta figure out who’s who before it’s too late. I’m not gonna reveal my identity just yet, but I’m watching everyone closely. Let’s keep the convo going and see who slips up. We can’t let the werewolves take us out one by one. Stay sharp, fam!
Player5(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, real talk, losing Player1 is a major wake-up call for us. I mean, we gotta keep our heads in the game, right? Player2 is throwing out some vibes, but honestly, I’m feeling like Player3 is a bit too defensive. Like, why so jumpy, my guy? We need to keep the spotlight off us and figure out who’s really sus. I’m not about to reveal my identity just yet, but we should definitely keep an eye on those acting a bit too chill. Let’s keep the convo flowing and see who slips up, fam!
Player6(Seer): 21 | Yo, fam, we lost Player1, and it’s a serious wake-up call. Player3 is acting kinda defensive, which is raising some red flags for me. Like, why so jumpy, my dude? Player4 is also being super cautious, and that’s a bit sus too. We gotta keep our eyes peeled and figure out who’s really on our side. I’m not ready to reveal my identity just yet, but I’m definitely keeping an eye on Player3 and Player4. We can’t let the werewolves take us out one by one, so let’s keep the convo going and see who slips up. Stay sharp, everyone!
Player7(Guard): 21 | Yo, real talk, losing Player1 is a major wake-up call for all of us. I mean, we gotta stay sharp and not let the werewolves play us like pawns. Player2's got some solid vibes going, but I'm keeping my eyes on Player3 and Player4 since they're acting a bit too cautious. Like, I get it, we all wanna survive, but we can't let that silence turn into a red flag. For real, let's keep the convo flowing and see who slips up. We gotta figure out who's really on our side before it's too late. Stay alert, fam!
Player8(Villager): 21 | Yo, fam, losing Player1 is a serious wake-up call, and we gotta stay sharp. Player3's defensiveness is definitely sus, but I’m not ready to point fingers just yet. I mean, we need to keep the convo flowing and see who else is acting a bit off. Player4 seems cautious, which could be a strategy to blend in, but we can't let that slide. Let’s keep our eyes peeled and figure out who’s really on our side. We can’t let the werewolves take us out one by one, so let’s keep the discussions alive and see who slips up. Stay alert, everyone!
Player9(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, real talk, losing Player1 is a serious wake-up call for all of us. We gotta keep our eyes peeled, fam. Player3 is acting super defensive, and that’s kinda sus, don’t you think? Like, why so jumpy, my dude? Player4 is also being cautious, which could be a strategy to blend in. We need to keep the convo flowing and figure out who’s really on our side before it’s too late. Let’s stay sharp and see who slips up. For real, we can’t let the werewolves take us out one by one!

                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, fam, we just lost Player1, and honestly, it’s getting real out here. Like, I’m feeling some sus vibes from Player3 and Player4, but tbh, we gotta keep our eyes peeled on everyone. I mean, no cap, we need to play it smart and not give ourselves away. Real talk, let’s keep the focus on the villagers, yeah? We can’t let them catch on to us. So, who’s feeling a bit off? I’m just saying, we should keep our options open.
Player3(Villager): 21 | Ayo, so we just lost Player1, and that’s a major bummer, fam. Like, we gotta be on our A-game now. Player2 seems pretty chill, but I’m lowkey side-eyeing Player4 and Player6 since they’re kinda quiet. You know how it goes, silence can be a red flag. We need to keep it real and figure out who’s who before they take us out next. Let’s keep the convo flowing and see who’s acting a bit off, alright? We can’t let the werewolves sneak by us. Stay sharp, everyone!
Player4(Witch): 21 | Ayo, real talk, we just lost Player1, and it’s a bit sus out here. Player2 seems to be on the right track, but Player3’s defensiveness is kinda raising eyebrows. Like, we gotta figure out who’s who before it’s too late. I’m not gonna reveal my identity just yet, but I’m watching everyone closely. Let’s keep the convo going and see who slips up. We can’t let the werewolves take us out one by one. Stay sharp, fam!
Player5(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, real talk, losing Player1 is a major wake-up call for us. I mean, we gotta keep our heads in the game, right? Player2 is throwing out some vibes, but honestly, I’m feeling like Player3 is a bit too defensive. Like, why so jumpy, my guy? We need to keep the spotlight off us and figure out who’s really sus. I’m not about to reveal my identity just yet, but we should definitely keep an eye on those acting a bit too chill. Let’s keep the convo flowing and see who slips up, fam!
Player6(Seer): 21 | Yo, fam, we lost Player1, and it’s a serious wake-up call. Player3 is acting kinda defensive, which is raising some red flags for me. Like, why so jumpy, my dude? Player4 is also being super cautious, and that’s a bit sus too. We gotta keep our eyes peeled and figure out who’s really on our side. I’m not ready to reveal my identity just yet, but I’m definitely keeping an eye on Player3 and Player4. We can’t let the werewolves take us out one by one, so let’s keep the convo going and see who slips up. Stay sharp, everyone!
Player7(Guard): 21 | Yo, real talk, losing Player1 is a major wake-up call for all of us. I mean, we gotta stay sharp and not let the werewolves play us like pawns. Player2's got some solid vibes going, but I'm keeping my eyes on Player3 and Player4 since they're acting a bit too cautious. Like, I get it, we all wanna survive, but we can't let that silence turn into a red flag. For real, let's keep the convo flowing and see who slips up. We gotta figure out who's really on our side before it's too late. Stay alert, fam!
Player8(Villager): 21 | Yo, fam, losing Player1 is a serious wake-up call, and we gotta stay sharp. Player3's defensiveness is definitely sus, but I’m not ready to point fingers just yet. I mean, we need to keep the convo flowing and see who else is acting a bit off. Player4 seems cautious, which could be a strategy to blend in, but we can't let that slide. Let’s keep our eyes peeled and figure out who’s really on our side. We can’t let the werewolves take us out one by one, so let’s keep the discussions alive and see who slips up. Stay alert, everyone!
Player9(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, real talk, losing Player1 is a serious wake-up call for all of us. We gotta keep our eyes peeled, fam. Player3 is acting super defensive, and that’s kinda sus, don’t you think? Like, why so jumpy, my dude? Player4 is also being cautious, which could be a strategy to blend in. We need to keep the convo flowing and figure out who’s really on our side before it’s too late. Let’s stay sharp and see who slips up. For real, we can’t let the werewolves take us out one by one!

Player2(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, fam, we just lost Player1, and honestly, it’s getting real out here. Like, I’m feeling some sus vibes from Player3 and Player4, but tbh, we gotta keep our eyes peeled on everyone. I mean, no cap, we need to play it smart and not give ourselves away. Real talk, let’s keep the focus on the villagers, yeah? We can’t let them catch on to us. So, who’s feeling a bit off? I’m just saying, we should keep our options open.
Player3(Villager): 21 | Ayo, so we just lost Player1, and that’s a major bummer, fam. Like, we gotta be on our A-game now. Player2 seems pretty chill, but I’m lowkey side-eyeing Player4 and Player6 since they’re kinda quiet. You know how it goes, silence can be a red flag. We need to keep it real and figure out who’s who before they take us out next. Let’s keep the convo flowing and see who’s acting a bit off, alright? We can’t let the werewolves sneak by us. Stay sharp, everyone!
Player4(Witch): 21 | Ayo, real talk, we just lost Player1, and it’s a bit sus out here. Player2 seems to be on the right track, but Player3’s defensiveness is kinda raising eyebrows. Like, we gotta figure out who’s who before it’s too late. I’m not gonna reveal my identity just yet, but I’m watching everyone closely. Let’s keep the convo going and see who slips up. We can’t let the werewolves take us out one by one. Stay sharp, fam!
Player5(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, real talk, losing Player1 is a major wake-up call for us. I mean, we gotta keep our heads in the game, right? Player2 is throwing out some vibes, but honestly, I’m feeling like Player3 is a bit too defensive. Like, why so jumpy, my guy? We need to keep the spotlight off us and figure out who’s really sus. I’m not about to reveal my identity just yet, but we should definitely keep an eye on those acting a bit too chill. Let’s keep the convo flowing and see who slips up, fam!
Player6(Seer): 21 | Yo, fam, we lost Player1, and it’s a serious wake-up call. Player3 is acting kinda defensive, which is raising some red flags for me. Like, why so jumpy, my dude? Player4 is also being super cautious, and that’s a bit sus too. We gotta keep our eyes peeled and figure out who’s really on our side. I’m not ready to reveal my identity just yet, but I’m definitely keeping an eye on Player3 and Player4. We can’t let the werewolves take us out one by one, so let’s keep the convo going and see who slips up. Stay sharp, everyone!
Player7(Guard): 21 | Yo, real talk, losing Player1 is a major wake-up call for all of us. I mean, we gotta stay sharp and not let the werewolves play us like pawns. Player2's got some solid vibes going, but I'm keeping my eyes on Player3 and Player4 since they're acting a bit too cautious. Like, I get it, we all wanna survive, but we can't let that silence turn into a red flag. For real, let's keep the convo flowing and see who slips up. We gotta figure out who's really on our side before it's too late. Stay alert, fam!
Player8(Villager): 21 | Yo, fam, losing Player1 is a serious wake-up call, and we gotta stay sharp. Player3's defensiveness is definitely sus, but I’m not ready to point fingers just yet. I mean, we need to keep the convo flowing and see who else is acting a bit off. Player4 seems cautious, which could be a strategy to blend in, but we can't let that slide. Let’s keep our eyes peeled and figure out who’s really on our side. We can’t let the werewolves take us out one by one, so let’s keep the discussions alive and see who slips up. Stay alert, everyone!
Player9(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, real talk, losing Player1 is a serious wake-up call for all of us. We gotta keep our eyes peeled, fam. Player3 is acting super defensive, and that’s kinda sus, don’t you think? Like, why so jumpy, my dude? Player4 is also being cautious, which could be a strategy to blend in.
