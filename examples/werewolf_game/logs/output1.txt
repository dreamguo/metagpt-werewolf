                    Choose only one from the following living options:['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'].
Player3(Seer): 16 | Verify Player1
Moderator(Moderator): 17 | Player1 is a good guy
Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Villager): 21 | I believe itâ€™s crucial for us to discuss our observations and suspicions. Since no one was killed last night, we have a chance to gather information. I am a villager, and I urge everyone to share their thoughts. Letâ€™s work together to identify the werewolves among us.
Player2(Witch): 21 | I believe we should continue discussing and gathering information. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and roles. This will help us identify the werewolves among us. I will hold off on revealing my identity for now, as it may put me at risk.
Player3(Seer): 21 | I believe it is important to share that I am the Seer and that I have verified Player1 as a good guy. This information can help us build trust and work together to identify the werewolves. I urge everyone to share their roles and observations so we can make an informed decision moving forward.
Player4(Villager): 21 | I believe we should continue to discuss our roles and observations. Player3's claim as the Seer adds valuable information to our group. I urge Player2 to consider revealing their role, as it may help us identify the werewolves more effectively. As a villager, I am committed to working with all of you to uncover the truth and eliminate the threats among us.
Player5(Guard): 21 | I believe itâ€™s important for us to continue discussing our observations. I am the Guard, and I protected Player2 last night. I urge everyone to share their roles and observations. Player3's claim as the Seer is valuable, and I support the idea of working together to identify the werewolves. Let's keep the conversation going and make informed decisions.
Player6(Werewolf): 21 | I believe we should consider the claims made by Player3 and Player5 carefully. While Player3 claims to be the Seer and has verified Player1, we must remember that we have limited information. It's crucial to keep discussing our roles and observations. I suggest we focus on gathering more information before making any decisions. Let's not rush into eliminating anyone without sufficient evidence. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and observations to help us identify the werewolves among us.
Player7(Werewolf): 21 | I believe we should continue discussing our roles and observations. Player3's claim as the Seer is intriguing, but we must remain cautious. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and consider the implications of our roles. Let's work together to identify potential threats without jumping to conclusions too quickly.

                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Villager): 21 | I believe itâ€™s crucial for us to discuss our observations and suspicions. Since no one was killed last night, we have a chance to gather information. I am a villager, and I urge everyone to share their thoughts. Letâ€™s work together to identify the werewolves among us.
Player2(Witch): 21 | I believe we should continue discussing and gathering information. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and roles. This will help us identify the werewolves among us. I will hold off on revealing my identity for now, as it may put me at risk.
Player3(Seer): 21 | I believe it is important to share that I am the Seer and that I have verified Player1 as a good guy. This information can help us build trust and work together to identify the werewolves. I urge everyone to share their roles and observations so we can make an informed decision moving forward.
Player4(Villager): 21 | I believe we should continue to discuss our roles and observations. Player3's claim as the Seer adds valuable information to our group. I urge Player2 to consider revealing their role, as it may help us identify the werewolves more effectively. As a villager, I am committed to working with all of you to uncover the truth and eliminate the threats among us.
Player5(Guard): 21 | I believe itâ€™s important for us to continue discussing our observations. I am the Guard, and I protected Player2 last night. I urge everyone to share their roles and observations. Player3's claim as the Seer is valuable, and I support the idea of working together to identify the werewolves. Let's keep the conversation going and make informed decisions.
Player6(Werewolf): 21 | I believe we should consider the claims made by Player3 and Player5 carefully. While Player3 claims to be the Seer and has verified Player1, we must remember that we have limited information. It's crucial to keep discussing our roles and observations. I suggest we focus on gathering more information before making any decisions. Let's not rush into eliminating anyone without sufficient evidence. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and observations to help us identify the werewolves among us.
Player7(Werewolf): 21 | I believe we should continue discussing our roles and observations. Player3's claim as the Seer is intriguing, but we must remain cautious. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and consider the implications of our roles. Let's work together to identify potential threats without jumping to conclusions too quickly.

Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Villager): 21 | I believe itâ€™s crucial for us to discuss our observations and suspicions. Since no one was killed last night, we have a chance to gather information. I am a villager, and I urge everyone to share their thoughts. Letâ€™s work together to identify the werewolves among us.
Player2(Witch): 21 | I believe we should continue discussing and gathering information. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and roles. This will help us identify the werewolves among us. I will hold off on revealing my identity for now, as it may put me at risk.
Player3(Seer): 21 | I believe it is important to share that I am the Seer and that I have verified Player1 as a good guy. This information can help us build trust and work together to identify the werewolves. I urge everyone to share their roles and observations so we can make an informed decision moving forward.
Player4(Villager): 21 | I believe we should continue to discuss our roles and observations. Player3's claim as the Seer adds valuable information to our group. I urge Player2 to consider revealing their role, as it may help us identify the werewolves more effectively. As a villager, I am committed to working with all of you to uncover the truth and eliminate the threats among us.
Player5(Guard): 21 | I believe itâ€™s important for us to continue discussing our observations. I am the Guard, and I protected Player2 last night. I urge everyone to share their roles and observations. Player3's claim as the Seer is valuable, and I support the idea of working together to identify the werewolves. Let's keep the conversation going and make informed decisions.
Player6(Werewolf): 21 | I believe we should consider the claims made by Player3 and Player5 carefully. While Player3 claims to be the Seer and has verified Player1, we must remember that we have limited information. It's crucial to keep discussing our roles and observations. I suggest we focus on gathering more information before making any decisions. Let's not rush into eliminating anyone without sufficient evidence. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and observations to help us identify the werewolves among us.
Player7(Werewolf): 21 | I believe we should continue discussing our roles and observations. Player3's claim as the Seer is intriguing, but we must remain cautious. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and consider the implications of our roles. Let's work together to identify potential threats without jumping to conclusions too quickly.

Player1(Villager): 45 | I believe it is important for me to reveal that I am a villager. I support Player3's claim as the Seer, and I urge everyone to continue sharing their observations.

Player3(Seer): 45 | I vote to eliminate Player6
Player4(Villager): 45 | I believe it is important to keep the momentum going in our discussions. I am a villager, and I support Player3's claim as the Seer. Player6's behavior raises some concerns, and I think we should consider eliminating them to reduce the risk of losing more players. I vote to eliminate Player6.
