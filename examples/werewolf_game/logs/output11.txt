Moderator(Moderator): 14 | Witch, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 15 | Seer, please open your eyes!
Moderator(Moderator): 16 | Seer, you can check one player's identity. Who are you going to verify its identity tonight?
                    Choose only one from the following living options:['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'].
Player6(Seer): 16 | Verify Player3
Moderator(Moderator): 17 | Player3 is a good guy
Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | ['Player1'] was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | I think we should take a moment to reflect on the situation. With Player1 gone, we need to analyze the remaining players carefully. I haven't seen any suspicious behavior from Player3, Player4, Player6, or Player7, but we should consider if anyone has been too quiet or evasive. It's crucial that we work together to identify any potential threats among us. Let's share our thoughts and observations to ensure we make the right decision moving forward.
Player3(Witch): 21 | I think itâ€™s important for us to continue discussing and analyzing the situation. I will hold off on revealing my identity for now and encourage everyone to share their observations. We need to identify any suspicious behavior among the remaining players.
Player4(Villager): 21 | I believe we should continue discussing and analyzing the situation. I am a Villager, and I encourage everyone to share their observations. Let's work together to identify any suspicious behavior among us.
Player5(Werewolf): 21 | I think itâ€™s essential for us to remain cautious and analyze the behavior of all players. While Player1's elimination was unfortunate, it does give us a chance to reflect on the remaining players. I believe Player3 has been quite neutral, and Player4 claims to be a villager, but we should keep an eye on them. Let's continue sharing our observations and work together to identify any suspicious behavior. Trust is crucial in this game, and I encourage everyone to speak up about their thoughts.
Player6(Seer): 21 | I will reveal my identity as the Seer. I verified Player3 as a good guy, and I encourage everyone to share their observations. We need to work together to identify any suspicious behavior among the remaining players.
Player7(Villager): 21 | I think we should trust Player6's revelation about Player3 and focus on Player5's suspicious behavior. I vote to eliminate Player5.

Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | I think we should take a moment to reflect on the situation. With Player1 gone, we need to analyze the remaining players carefully. I haven't seen any suspicious behavior from Player3, Player4, Player6, or Player7, but we should consider if anyone has been too quiet or evasive. It's crucial that we work together to identify any potential threats among us. Let's share our thoughts and observations to ensure we make the right decision moving forward.
Player3(Witch): 21 | I think itâ€™s important for us to continue discussing and analyzing the situation. I will hold off on revealing my identity for now and encourage everyone to share their observations. We need to identify any suspicious behavior among the remaining players.
Player4(Villager): 21 | I believe we should continue discussing and analyzing the situation. I am a Villager, and I encourage everyone to share their observations. Let's work together to identify any suspicious behavior among us.
Player5(Werewolf): 21 | I think itâ€™s essential for us to remain cautious and analyze the behavior of all players. While Player1's elimination was unfortunate, it does give us a chance to reflect on the remaining players. I believe Player3 has been quite neutral, and Player4 claims to be a villager, but we should keep an eye on them. Let's continue sharing our observations and work together to identify any suspicious behavior. Trust is crucial in this game, and I encourage everyone to speak up about their thoughts.
Player6(Seer): 21 | I will reveal my identity as the Seer. I verified Player3 as a good guy, and I encourage everyone to share their observations. We need to work together to identify any suspicious behavior among the remaining players.
Player7(Villager): 21 | I think we should trust Player6's revelation about Player3 and focus on Player5's suspicious behavior. I vote to eliminate Player5.

Moderator(Moderator): 31 | Werewolves, I secretly tell you that ['Player2', 'Player5'] are
                   all of the 2 werewolves! Keep in mind you are teammates. The rest players are not werewolves.

                   ['Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player6', 'Player7']. For example: Kill ...

                   If so, say ONLY "Poison PlayerX", replace PlayerX with the actual player name, else, say "Pass".

Moderator(Moderator): 39 | Witch, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 40 | Seer, please open your eyes!
Moderator(Moderator): 41 | Seer, you can check one player's identity. Who are you going to verify its identity tonight?
                    Choose only one from the following living options:['Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player6', 'Player7'].
Player6(Seer): 41 | Verify Player4
Moderator(Moderator): 42 | Player4 is a good guy
Moderator(Moderator): 43 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 44 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 45 | ['Player6'] was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 46 | Living players: ['Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player2(Werewolf): 46 | I think we need to be cautious moving forward. With Player6, the Seer, eliminated, we have lost a valuable source of information. I believe Player3 and Player4 have not claimed any roles yet, which makes them potential threats. We should focus our discussions on them and analyze their behavior closely. I encourage everyone to share their thoughts and observations. Trust is crucial, and we need to work together to identify any suspicious behavior among us. Let's not rush into any decisions without careful consideration.
Player3(Witch): 46 | I think we should focus on Player2, who has been cautious but hasn't revealed any role. I vote to eliminate Player2.
Player4(Villager): 46 | I vote to eliminate Player2
Player7(Villager): 46 | I think we should focus on Player3, who has been quick to accuse Player2 without revealing their role. I vote to eliminate Player3.
Moderator(Moderator): 47 | Understood
Moderator(Moderator): 48 | Now vote and tell me who you think is the werewolf. Donâ€™t mention your role.
                    You only choose one from the following living options please:
                    ['Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player7']. Say ONLY: I vote to eliminate ...
Player2(Werewolf): 48 | I vote to eliminate Player3
Player3(Witch): 48 | I vote to eliminate Player2
Player4(Villager): 48 | I vote to eliminate Player3
Player7(Villager): 48 | I vote to eliminate Player3
