                    Choose only one from the following living options:['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'].
Player3(Seer): 16 | Verify Player1
Moderator(Moderator): 17 | Player1 is a werewolf
Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Werewolf): 21 | Darling, can we talk about how suspicious Player2 is acting? I mean, they haven't contributed anything to the discussion! It's like they are trying to blend in and avoid drawing attention. We need to keep an eye on them, don't you think? Let's make sure we don't overlook any potential threats!
Player2(Guard): 21 | I think it's important to address the concerns raised by Player1. While I appreciate their vigilance, I want to clarify that I am the Guard and I protected myself last night. I believe we should focus on gathering more information before making any hasty decisions. Let's discuss our observations further!
Player3(Seer): 21 | I believe it is important for me to reveal my identity. I am the Seer, and I verified Player1's identity, confirming that they are a werewolf. We need to eliminate Player1 to protect the villagers. I urge everyone to consider this information seriously.
Player4(Villager): 21 | I vote to eliminate Player1
Player5(Villager): 21 | I vote to eliminate Player1
Player6(Werewolf): 21 | I think we should consider the possibility that Player3 might be misleading us. Their sudden claim to be the Seer and accusation against Player1 seems too convenient. We need to be cautious and gather more information before making any decisions. Let's not rush into eliminating someone based on a single claim.
Player7(Witch): 21 | Darling, I must say, the drama unfolding here is absolutely riveting! ðŸ’… While Player3's claim about Player1 being a werewolf is quite bold, we cannot overlook the possibility that Player3 may be playing us. However, I believe we should lean towards the majority and eliminate Player1 for the sake of the villagers. I vote to eliminate Player1.
Moderator(Moderator): 22 | Understood
Moderator(Moderator): 23 | Now vote and tell me who you think is the werewolf. Donâ€™t mention your role.

Player1 has been confirmed as a werewolf and eliminated, which means I need to focus on verifying the identities of the remaining players to ensure the safety of the villagers. 2. Player2 claims to be the Guard, which could be a valid role but also a potential deception. 3. I will choose to verify Player2 tonight to confirm their claim and assess whether they are truly protecting the villagers or if they might be hiding something.",

Player3(Seer): 16 | Verify Player1
Moderator(Moderator): 17 | Player1 is a werewolf
Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Werewolf): 21 | Darling, can we talk about how suspicious Player2 is acting? I mean, they haven't contributed anything to the discussion! It's like they are trying to blend in and avoid drawing attention. We need to keep an eye on them, don't you think? Let's make sure we don't overlook any potential threats!
Player2(Guard): 21 | I think it's important to address the concerns raised by Player1. While I appreciate their vigilance, I want to clarify that I am the Guard and I protected myself last night. I believe we should focus on gathering more information before making any hasty decisions. Let's discuss our observations further!
Player3(Seer): 21 | I believe it is important for me to reveal my identity. I am the Seer, and I verified Player1's identity, confirming that they are a werewolf. We need to eliminate Player1 to protect the villagers. I urge everyone to consider this information seriously.
Player4(Villager): 21 | I vote to eliminate Player1
Player5(Villager): 21 | I vote to eliminate Player1
Player6(Werewolf): 21 | I think we should consider the possibility that Player3 might be misleading us. Their sudden claim to be the Seer and accusation against Player1 seems too convenient. We need to be cautious and gather more information before making any decisions. Let's not rush into eliminating someone based on a single claim.
Player7(Witch): 21 | Darling, I must say, the drama unfolding here is absolutely riveting! ðŸ’… While Player3's claim about Player1 being a werewolf is quite bold, we cannot overlook the possibility that Player3 may be playing us. However, I believe we should lean towards the majority and eliminate Player1 for the sake of the villagers. I vote to eliminate Player1.
