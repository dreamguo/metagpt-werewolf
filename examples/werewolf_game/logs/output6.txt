                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Guard): 47 | I believe it is important to maintain our current strategy and protect our remaining players. I will not reveal my identity yet, as it may put me at risk. I urge everyone to continue discussing and sharing their observations. Let's remain vigilant and work together to identify any remaining threats.
Player2(Villager): 47 | I vote to eliminate Player4.
Player4(Werewolf): 47 | I believe we should take a moment to consider the claims being made. Player5 has positioned themselves as the Seer, but we must be cautious about blindly trusting this information. It's important to remember that anyone can claim a role, and we should evaluate their actions carefully. I urge everyone to share their observations and consider whether Player5's accusations are truly valid. Let's not rush into a decision without fully discussing the implications.
Player5(Seer): 47 | I vote to eliminate Player4.
