Moderator(Moderator): 2 | Guard, now tell me who you protect tonight?
                   You only choose one from the following living options please: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'].
                   Or you can pass. For example: Protect ...

Moderator(Moderator): 6 | Werewolves, I secretly tell you that ['Player2', 'Player3'] are
                   all of the 2 werewolves! Keep in mind you are teammates. The rest players are not werewolves.
                   choose one from the following living options please:
                   ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7']. For example: Kill ...

Moderator(Moderator): 9 | Witch, please open your eyes!
Moderator(Moderator): 10 | Witch, tonight Player1 has been killed by the werewolves.
                   You have a bottle of antidote, would you like to save him/her? If so, say "Save", else, say "Pass".
Player1(Witch): 10 | PASS
Moderator(Moderator): 11 | Understood
Moderator(Moderator): 12 | Witch, you also have a bottle of poison, would you like to use it to kill one of the living players?
                   Choose one from the following living options: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'].
                   If so, say ONLY "Poison PlayerX", replace PlayerX with the actual player name, else, say "Pass".

Moderator(Moderator): 13 | Understood
Moderator(Moderator): 14 | Witch, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 15 | Seer, please open your eyes!
Moderator(Moderator): 16 | Seer, you can check one player's identity. Who are you going to verify its identity tonight?
                    Choose only one from the following living options:['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'].
Player7(Seer): 16 | Verify Player1
Moderator(Moderator): 17 | Player1 is a good guy
Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | ['Player1'] was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | I think we should discuss who we believe might be the next target for the werewolves. It's crucial that we work together to identify any suspicious behavior among the remaining players. I believe we should keep an eye on Player4, Player5, and Player6, as they haven't made any claims yet. Let's gather more information before making any decisions.
Player3(Werewolf): 21 | I agree with Player2 that we should focus on gathering more information. I think we should pay attention to how Player4, Player5, and Player6 respond to our discussions. Their lack of claims makes them potential targets for suspicion. Let's keep an eye on their behavior and see if we can identify any inconsistencies.
Player4(Guard): 21 | I believe we should focus on gathering more information before making any decisions. I will keep my identity as the Guard hidden for now to protect my ability to safeguard a player tonight. Let's continue discussing and observing the behaviors of Player5, Player6, and Player7.
Player5(Villager): 21 | I think we should continue discussing and observing Player6 and Player7, as their silence raises suspicion. I vote to eliminate Player6.
Player6(Villager): 21 | I think it's important to address the accusations against me. Player5's attempt to eliminate me seems unfounded, especially since I have not made any claims that would warrant such suspicion. I urge everyone to consider Player5's motives and to discuss openly rather than jumping to conclusions. Let's work together to identify the real threats among us.
Player7(Seer): 21 | I think we should focus on Player5's behavior, as their attempt to eliminate Player6 seems unfounded and could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves. I urge everyone to consider the implications of their accusations and work together to identify the real threats. I will keep my identity as Seer hidden for now to avoid becoming a target.

Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | I think we should discuss who we believe might be the next target for the werewolves. It's crucial that we work together to identify any suspicious behavior among the remaining players. I believe we should keep an eye on Player4, Player5, and Player6, as they haven't made any claims yet. Let's gather more information before making any decisions.
Player3(Werewolf): 21 | I agree with Player2 that we should focus on gathering more information. I think we should pay attention to how Player4, Player5, and Player6 respond to our discussions. Their lack of claims makes them potential targets for suspicion. Let's keep an eye on their behavior and see if we can identify any inconsistencies.
Player4(Guard): 21 | I believe we should focus on gathering more information before making any decisions. I will keep my identity as the Guard hidden for now to protect my ability to safeguard a player tonight. Let's continue discussing and observing the behaviors of Player5, Player6, and Player7.
Player5(Villager): 21 | I think we should continue discussing and observing Player6 and Player7, as their silence raises suspicion. I vote to eliminate Player6.
Player6(Villager): 21 | I think it's important to address the accusations against me. Player5's attempt to eliminate me seems unfounded, especially since I have not made any claims that would warrant such suspicion. I urge everyone to consider Player5's motives and to discuss openly rather than jumping to conclusions. Let's work together to identify the real threats among us.
Player7(Seer): 21 | I think we should focus on Player5's behavior, as their attempt to eliminate Player6 seems unfounded and could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves. I urge everyone to consider the implications of their accusations and work together to identify the real threats. I will keep my identity as Seer hidden for now to avoid becoming a target.

Moderator(Moderator): 44 | ['Player4'] was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 45 | Living players: ['Player2', 'Player3', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player2(Werewolf): 45 | I think we should focus on Player6 and Player7, as their silence raises suspicion. We need to gather more information before making any decisions. I vote to eliminate Player6.
Player3(Werewolf): 45 | I vote to eliminate Player6.
Player6(Villager): 45 | I think it's important to address the accusations against me. Player2 and Player3 are quick to point fingers, but I urge everyone to consider their motives. I believe we should focus on gathering more information before making any decisions. I vote to eliminate Player2.
Player7(Seer): 45 | I will reveal my identity as the Seer. I verified Player4 as a good guy, which means we need to be cautious about Player2 and Player3's accusations against Player6. We should work together to identify the werewolves among us.
