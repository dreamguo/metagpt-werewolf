                   all of the 2 werewolves! Keep in mind you are teammates. The rest players are not werewolves.
                   choose one from the following living options please:
                   ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7']. For example: Kill ...

                   You have a bottle of antidote, would you like to save him/her? If so, say "Save", else, say "Pass".
Player3(Witch): 10 | SAVE
Moderator(Moderator): 11 | Understood
Moderator(Moderator): 12 | Witch, you also have a bottle of poison, would you like to use it to kill one of the living players?

                   If so, say ONLY "Poison PlayerX", replace PlayerX with the actual player name, else, say "Pass".
Player3(Witch): 12 | PASS
Moderator(Moderator): 13 | Understood
Moderator(Moderator): 14 | Witch, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 15 | Seer, please open your eyes!
Moderator(Moderator): 16 | Seer, you can check one player's identity. Who are you going to verify its identity tonight?
                    Choose only one from the following living options:['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'].
Player1(Seer): 16 | Verify Player2
Moderator(Moderator): 17 | Player2 is a good guy
Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Seer): 21 | Listen here, darlings! As the Seer, I have confirmed that Player2 is a good guy. This is vital information for our team! We need to work together to identify the werewolves among us. I suggest we discuss our observations and any suspicions we might have. Remember, we are all in this together, and the more we share, the better our chances of survival. Let's strategize and eliminate the threat before it's too late!
Player2(Guard): 21 | I think it’s crucial to share my observations without revealing my identity just yet. I believe we should focus on discussing our suspicions and gather more information before making any decisions. Let's keep the conversation going and see if anyone stands out as suspicious!
Player3(Witch): 21 | I think it’s important to share my perspective as the Witch. While I have saved Player1, I am still cautious about trusting Player1's claim. We need to discuss our suspicions further and gather more information before making any decisions. I suggest we focus on identifying any inconsistencies in Player1 or Player2's statements to ensure we are not misled.
Player4(Villager): 21 | I think it’s important to support Player1’s claim as the Seer while remaining cautious. We should continue discussing our observations and suspicions. I suggest we focus on identifying any inconsistencies in Player1 or Player2's statements. Let’s collaborate and strategize to eliminate the werewolves among us.
Player5(Villager): 21 | I vote to eliminate Player3
Player6(Werewolf): 21 | I think we should be cautious about Player1's claim as the Seer. While Player2 seems to support them, we need to consider the possibility that Player1 could be misleading us. Player3's caution is also worth noting, as they claim to be the Witch but are skeptical of Player1. I suggest we focus on Player3 and investigate their credibility further. Let's keep discussing our observations and see if we can identify any inconsistencies in their statements.
Player7(Werewolf): 21 | Darlings, I must say, while Player1's claim as the Seer is quite dramatic, we should remain cautious. Player3's skepticism is also serving some real tea! Let’s not forget that Player2 is backing Player1, which could be a strategic play. I suggest we keep our eyes on Player1 and Player2 for now and gather more observations before we make any bold moves. After all, we wouldn’t want to eliminate a valuable ally, would we? Let’s keep the conversation flowing, darlings! 💅✨

Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Seer): 21 | Listen here, darlings! As the Seer, I have confirmed that Player2 is a good guy. This is vital information for our team! We need to work together to identify the werewolves among us. I suggest we discuss our observations and any suspicions we might have. Remember, we are all in this together, and the more we share, the better our chances of survival. Let's strategize and eliminate the threat before it's too late!
Player2(Guard): 21 | I think it’s crucial to share my observations without revealing my identity just yet. I believe we should focus on discussing our suspicions and gather more information before making any decisions. Let's keep the conversation going and see if anyone stands out as suspicious!
Player3(Witch): 21 | I think it’s important to share my perspective as the Witch. While I have saved Player1, I am still cautious about trusting Player1's claim. We need to discuss our suspicions further and gather more information before making any decisions. I suggest we focus on identifying any inconsistencies in Player1 or Player2's statements to ensure we are not misled.
Player4(Villager): 21 | I think it’s important to support Player1’s claim as the Seer while remaining cautious. We should continue discussing our observations and suspicions. I suggest we focus on identifying any inconsistencies in Player1 or Player2's statements. Let’s collaborate and strategize to eliminate the werewolves among us.
Player5(Villager): 21 | I vote to eliminate Player3
Player6(Werewolf): 21 | I think we should be cautious about Player1's claim as the Seer. While Player2 seems to support them, we need to consider the possibility that Player1 could be misleading us. Player3's caution is also worth noting, as they claim to be the Witch but are skeptical of Player1. I suggest we focus on Player3 and investigate their credibility further. Let's keep discussing our observations and see if we can identify any inconsistencies in their statements.
Player7(Werewolf): 21 | Darlings, I must say, while Player1's claim as the Seer is quite dramatic, we should remain cautious. Player3's skepticism is also serving some real tea! Let’s not forget that Player2 is backing Player1, which could be a strategic play. I suggest we keep our eyes on Player1 and Player2 for now and gather more observations before we make any bold moves. After all, we wouldn’t want to eliminate a valuable ally, would we? Let’s keep the conversation flowing, darlings! 💅✨

Moderator(Moderator): 45 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Seer): 45 | Listen up, everyone! I have vital information that we cannot ignore. Player6 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and we need to act decisively. I understand that some of you might be skeptical, but we must prioritize our survival and eliminate the threat among us. I urge you all to focus on Player6's behavior and statements; they have been suspicious throughout our discussions. Let’s unite and vote to eliminate Player6, ensuring the safety of our team. Together, we can win this!
Player2(Guard): 45 | I vote to eliminate Player6
Player4(Villager): 45 | I vote to eliminate Player6
Player5(Villager): 45 | I vote to eliminate Player6
Player6(Werewolf): 45 | I think we should take a moment to reflect on Player1's claim as the Seer. While their assertion is compelling, we must consider the possibility that they could be misleading us. Player2's support for Player1 raises some flags as well. We need to investigate further before making any rash decisions. Let's keep our eyes open and discuss our observations more thoroughly.
Player7(Werewolf): 45 | Darlings, while Player1's claim as the Seer is quite dramatic, we must remain cautious. Player2's unwavering support for Player1 raises some flags! Let's not forget that Player4 and Player5 are also backing Player1, which could be a strategic play. I suggest we keep our eyes on Player1 and Player2 for now and gather more observations before we make any bold moves. After all, we wouldn’t want to eliminate a valuable ally, would we? Let’s keep the conversation flowing, darlings! 💅✨
Moderator(Moderator): 46 | Understood

Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Seer): 21 | Listen here, darlings! As the Seer, I have confirmed that Player2 is a good guy. This is vital information for our team! We need to work together to identify the werewolves among us. I suggest we discuss our observations and any suspicions we might have. Remember, we are all in this together, and the more we share, the better our chances of survival. Let's strategize and eliminate the threat before it's too late!
Player2(Guard): 21 | I think it’s crucial to share my observations without revealing my identity just yet. I believe we should focus on discussing our suspicions and gather more information before making any decisions. Let's keep the conversation going and see if anyone stands out as suspicious!
Player3(Witch): 21 | I think it’s important to share my perspective as the Witch. While I have saved Player1, I am still cautious about trusting Player1's claim. We need to discuss our suspicions further and gather more information before making any decisions. I suggest we focus on identifying any inconsistencies in Player1 or Player2's statements to ensure we are not misled.
Player4(Villager): 21 | I think it’s important to support Player1’s claim as the Seer while remaining cautious. We should continue discussing our observations and suspicions. I suggest we focus on identifying any inconsistencies in Player1 or Player2's statements. Let’s collaborate and strategize to eliminate the werewolves among us.
Player5(Villager): 21 | I vote to eliminate Player3
Player6(Werewolf): 21 | I think we should be cautious about Player1's claim as the Seer. While Player2 seems to support them, we need to consider the possibility that Player1 could be misleading us. Player3's caution is also worth noting, as they claim to be the Witch but are skeptical of Player1. I suggest we focus on Player3 and investigate their credibility further. Let's keep discussing our observations and see if we can identify any inconsistencies in their statements.
Player7(Werewolf): 21 | Darlings, I must say, while Player1's claim as the Seer is quite dramatic, we should remain cautious. Player3's skepticism is also serving some real tea! Let’s not forget that Player2 is backing Player1, which could be a strategic play. I suggest we keep our eyes on Player1 and Player2 for now and gather more observations before we make any bold moves. After all, we wouldn’t want to eliminate a valuable ally, would we? Let’s keep the conversation flowing, darlings! 💅✨

                   You have a bottle of antidote, would you like to save him/her? If so, say "Save", else, say "Pass".
Moderator(Moderator): 37 | Witch, you also have a bottle of poison, would you like to use it to kill one of the living players?

                   If so, say ONLY "Poison PlayerX", replace PlayerX with the actual player name, else, say "Pass".
Moderator(Moderator): 38 | Witch, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 39 | Seer, please open your eyes!
Moderator(Moderator): 40 | Seer, you can check one player's identity. Who are you going to verify its identity tonight?
                    Choose only one from the following living options:['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'].
Player1(Seer): 40 | Verify Player6
Moderator(Moderator): 41 | Player6 is a werewolf
Moderator(Moderator): 42 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 43 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 44 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 45 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Seer): 45 | Listen up, everyone! I have vital information that we cannot ignore. Player6 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and we need to act decisively. I understand that some of you might be skeptical, but we must prioritize our survival and eliminate the threat among us. I urge you all to focus on Player6's behavior and statements; they have been suspicious throughout our discussions. Let’s unite and vote to eliminate Player6, ensuring the safety of our team. Together, we can win this!
Player2(Guard): 45 | I vote to eliminate Player6
Player4(Villager): 45 | I vote to eliminate Player6
Player5(Villager): 45 | I vote to eliminate Player6
Player6(Werewolf): 45 | I think we should take a moment to reflect on Player1's claim as the Seer. While their assertion is compelling, we must consider the possibility that they could be misleading us. Player2's support for Player1 raises some flags as well. We need to investigate further before making any rash decisions. Let's keep our eyes open and discuss our observations more thoroughly.
Player7(Werewolf): 45 | Darlings, while Player1's claim as the Seer is quite dramatic, we must remain cautious. Player2's unwavering support for Player1 raises some flags! Let's not forget that Player4 and Player5 are also backing Player1, which could be a strategic play. I suggest we keep our eyes on Player1 and Player2 for now and gather more observations before we make any bold moves. After all, we wouldn’t want to eliminate a valuable ally, would we? Let’s keep the conversation flowing, darlings! 💅✨
