                    Choose only one from the following living options:['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'].
Player3(Seer): 16 | Verify Player1
Moderator(Moderator): 17 | Player1 is a good guy
Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Witch): 21 | Listen up, everyone! We need to discuss what happened last night. I saved Player1, and I think we should focus on who might be acting suspiciously. Let's share our observations and see if anyone has any insights. Remember, we need to work together to identify the werewolves among us!
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | Hey everyone! ðŸŒŸ I think we should take a closer look at Player1's claim. While it's great that they saved someone, it raises some questions. How can we be sure they aren't just trying to deflect suspicion? ðŸ¤” Let's discuss who else might be acting suspiciously. We need to work together to uncover the truth! Remember, trust is key! ðŸ’–
Player3(Seer): 21 | I believe we should focus on Player1's claim. While I know they are a villager, their assertion is suspicious. Player2 is right to question it, and we should discuss further to identify any werewolves. I will reveal my identity as the Seer to gain trust and provide crucial information. I confirm that Player1 is a good guy, but we need to be cautious and keep an eye on Player1's behavior moving forward.
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | Ahhh, fellow villagers, let us gather our thoughts and reflect on the unfolding events. Player1's assertion of saving someone is intriguing, yet it invites scrutiny. While Player3 claims to be the Seer, I urge caution in blindly trusting their words. We must remain vigilant and question the intentions behind these revelations. Collaboration is key, but let us not forget the shadows that may lurk among us. I propose we delve deeper into our discussions to unearth the truth, for the night brings whispers of uncertainty. Together, we can navigate this labyrinth of deception and emerge victorious!

                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Witch): 21 | Listen up, everyone! We need to discuss what happened last night. I saved Player1, and I think we should focus on who might be acting suspiciously. Let's share our observations and see if anyone has any insights. Remember, we need to work together to identify the werewolves among us!
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | Hey everyone! ðŸŒŸ I think we should take a closer look at Player1's claim. While it's great that they saved someone, it raises some questions. How can we be sure they aren't just trying to deflect suspicion? ðŸ¤” Let's discuss who else might be acting suspiciously. We need to work together to uncover the truth! Remember, trust is key! ðŸ’–
Player3(Seer): 21 | I believe we should focus on Player1's claim. While I know they are a villager, their assertion is suspicious. Player2 is right to question it, and we should discuss further to identify any werewolves. I will reveal my identity as the Seer to gain trust and provide crucial information. I confirm that Player1 is a good guy, but we need to be cautious and keep an eye on Player1's behavior moving forward.
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | Ahhh, fellow villagers, let us gather our thoughts and reflect on the unfolding events. Player1's assertion of saving someone is intriguing, yet it invites scrutiny. While Player3 claims to be the Seer, I urge caution in blindly trusting their words. We must remain vigilant and question the intentions behind these revelations. Collaboration is key, but let us not forget the shadows that may lurk among us. I propose we delve deeper into our discussions to unearth the truth, for the night brings whispers of uncertainty. Together, we can navigate this labyrinth of deception and emerge victorious!

I am the Seer, and I verified Player2 as a werewolf last night. With Player2 gone, we are left with three villagers: Player4, Player6, and Player7. I urge you all to share your thoughts and observations. We need to work together to ensure we eliminate any remaining threats and secure our victory. Let's discuss and decide on our next move!
Player4(Werewolf): 47 | Fellow villagers, as we gather in this moment of reflection, I must express my concerns regarding Player3's assertion of being the Seer. While their claim may seem credible, we must not forget that deception can wear many faces. It is crucial that we remain vigilant and question the motivations behind such declarations. Player6 and Player7 have yet to reveal their roles, which adds an air of mystery. Let us not be swayed by mere words but instead seek the truth hidden beneath the surface. I urge you all to share your thoughts and observations, for in unity we can uncover the shadows that threaten our village.
