Moderator(Moderator): 1 | Guard, please open your eyes!
Moderator(Moderator): 2 | Guard, now tell me who you protect tonight?
                   You only choose one from the following living options please: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'].
                   Or you can pass. For example: Protect ...
Player1(Guard): 2 | Protect Player1

Moderator(Moderator): 4 | Guard, close your eyes

Moderator(Moderator): 6 | Werewolves, I secretly tell you that ['Player3', 'Player5'] are
                   all of the 2 werewolves! Keep in mind you are teammates. The rest players are not werewolves.
                   choose one from the following living options please:
                   ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7']. For example: Kill ...

                   If so, say ONLY "Poison PlayerX", replace PlayerX with the actual player name, else, say "Pass".
Player6(Witch): 12 | PASS
Moderator(Moderator): 13 | Understood
Moderator(Moderator): 14 | Witch, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 15 | Seer, please open your eyes!
Moderator(Moderator): 16 | Seer, you can check one player's identity. Who are you going to verify its identity tonight?
                    Choose only one from the following living options:['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'].
Player4(Seer): 16 | Verify Player2
Moderator(Moderator): 17 | Player2 is a good guy
Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Guard): 21 | Listen sweetie, let's fix this mess together. I protected myself last night, and since no one died, I believe my role is crucial in keeping the villagers safe. I suggest we discuss who seems suspicious among us, as we need to eliminate the werewolves before they take us out one by one. Let's work together to identify the threats.
Player2(Villager): 21 | I think we should take a moment to evaluate Player1's claim as the guard. If they are indeed telling the truth, it could be pivotal for our strategy moving forward. However, we should also consider that werewolves could be among us, and we need to identify them. I encourage everyone to share their thoughts and observations, as this will help us in our quest to eliminate the threats. Let's work together and figure out who seems suspicious!
Player3(Werewolf): 21 | Listen everyone, while I appreciate Player1's claim about being the guard, we need to be cautious. It's easy to make such claims when no one was killed. We should consider the possibility that this could be a tactic to gain trust. I suggest we evaluate all players' behaviors and statements closely. Let's not jump to conclusions based on a single claim. We need to work together to identify the real threats among us.
Player4(Seer): 21 | I believe it is essential to share my identity as the Seer. I verified Player2's identity, and they are indeed a good guy. This means we can trust them in our discussions moving forward. I urge everyone to consider Player1's claim critically, as it could be a tactic to gain our trust. Let's work together to identify the werewolves among us.
Player5(Werewolf): 21 | Chill, everyone! I think we should take a step back and evaluate Player1's claim. While they say they're the guard, we need to be cautious. Player4 has confirmed Player2, which is solid info for us. Let's keep our eyes open and discuss who seems suspicious. We need to work together to figure out who the real threats are among us!
Player6(Witch): 21 | I believe we need to be cautious about Player1's claim as the guard. While they may be telling the truth, it could also be a tactic to gain our trust. Player4's revelation as the Seer and confirmation of Player2 as a villager gives us some solid ground to work from. I suggest we continue discussing and evaluating everyone's claims before making any votes. Let's work together to identify the real threats among us.
Player7(Villager): 21 | Listen everyone, I appreciate the discussions happening here. Player1's claim as the guard is crucial, but we must remain vigilant. Player4's confirmation of Player2 adds a layer of trust, but we still need to evaluate Player1's role carefully. I suggest we continue to share our observations and work together to identify any suspicious behavior. Let's keep our focus on the goal of eliminating the werewolves while ensuring we protect our own. I am here to support the team and will share my thoughts as we move forward.

Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Guard): 21 | Listen sweetie, let's fix this mess together. I protected myself last night, and since no one died, I believe my role is crucial in keeping the villagers safe. I suggest we discuss who seems suspicious among us, as we need to eliminate the werewolves before they take us out one by one. Let's work together to identify the threats.
Player2(Villager): 21 | I think we should take a moment to evaluate Player1's claim as the guard. If they are indeed telling the truth, it could be pivotal for our strategy moving forward. However, we should also consider that werewolves could be among us, and we need to identify them. I encourage everyone to share their thoughts and observations, as this will help us in our quest to eliminate the threats. Let's work together and figure out who seems suspicious!
Player3(Werewolf): 21 | Listen everyone, while I appreciate Player1's claim about being the guard, we need to be cautious. It's easy to make such claims when no one was killed. We should consider the possibility that this could be a tactic to gain trust. I suggest we evaluate all players' behaviors and statements closely. Let's not jump to conclusions based on a single claim. We need to work together to identify the real threats among us.
Player4(Seer): 21 | I believe it is essential to share my identity as the Seer. I verified Player2's identity, and they are indeed a good guy. This means we can trust them in our discussions moving forward. I urge everyone to consider Player1's claim critically, as it could be a tactic to gain our trust. Let's work together to identify the werewolves among us.
Player5(Werewolf): 21 | Chill, everyone! I think we should take a step back and evaluate Player1's claim. While they say they're the guard, we need to be cautious. Player4 has confirmed Player2, which is solid info for us. Let's keep our eyes open and discuss who seems suspicious. We need to work together to figure out who the real threats are among us!
Player6(Witch): 21 | I believe we need to be cautious about Player1's claim as the guard. While they may be telling the truth, it could also be a tactic to gain our trust. Player4's revelation as the Seer and confirmation of Player2 as a villager gives us some solid ground to work from. I suggest we continue discussing and evaluating everyone's claims before making any votes. Let's work together to identify the real threats among us.
Player7(Villager): 21 | Listen everyone, I appreciate the discussions happening here. Player1's claim as the guard is crucial, but we must remain vigilant. Player4's confirmation of Player2 adds a layer of trust, but we still need to evaluate Player1's role carefully. I suggest we continue to share our observations and work together to identify any suspicious behavior. Let's keep our focus on the goal of eliminating the werewolves while ensuring we protect our own. I am here to support the team and will share my thoughts as we move forward.

Player3(Werewolf): 46 | Listen everyone, while I appreciate Player4's claim as the Seer, we need to be cautious. It's possible that this could be a tactic to gain our trust and mislead us. We should evaluate Player4's behavior closely, as their confirmation of Player2 could be a strategy to eliminate potential threats. Let's not forget that we still have to identify the real werewolves among us, and I urge everyone to share their observations. We need to work together to ensure we make the right decisions moving forward.
Player4(Seer): 46 | I believe it is crucial to share my identity as the Seer. I have confirmed Player2 as a good guy, and their death raises concerns about the remaining players. I urge everyone to consider Player3's behavior critically, as their skepticism could indicate ulterior motives. We need to work together to identify the werewolf among us.
Player5(Werewolf): 46 | I vote to eliminate Player4
Player6(Witch): 46 | I vote to eliminate Player4
Player7(Villager): 46 | I vote to eliminate Player4

Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Guard): 21 | Listen sweetie, let's fix this mess together. I protected myself last night, and since no one died, I believe my role is crucial in keeping the villagers safe. I suggest we discuss who seems suspicious among us, as we need to eliminate the werewolves before they take us out one by one. Let's work together to identify the threats.
Player2(Villager): 21 | I think we should take a moment to evaluate Player1's claim as the guard. If they are indeed telling the truth, it could be pivotal for our strategy moving forward. However, we should also consider that werewolves could be among us, and we need to identify them. I encourage everyone to share their thoughts and observations, as this will help us in our quest to eliminate the threats. Let's work together and figure out who seems suspicious!
Player3(Werewolf): 21 | Listen everyone, while I appreciate Player1's claim about being the guard, we need to be cautious. It's easy to make such claims when no one was killed. We should consider the possibility that this could be a tactic to gain trust. I suggest we evaluate all players' behaviors and statements closely. Let's not jump to conclusions based on a single claim. We need to work together to identify the real threats among us.
Player4(Seer): 21 | I believe it is essential to share my identity as the Seer. I verified Player2's identity, and they are indeed a good guy. This means we can trust them in our discussions moving forward. I urge everyone to consider Player1's claim critically, as it could be a tactic to gain our trust. Let's work together to identify the werewolves among us.
Player5(Werewolf): 21 | Chill, everyone! I think we should take a step back and evaluate Player1's claim. While they say they're the guard, we need to be cautious. Player4 has confirmed Player2, which is solid info for us. Let's keep our eyes open and discuss who seems suspicious. We need to work together to figure out who the real threats are among us!
Player6(Witch): 21 | I believe we need to be cautious about Player1's claim as the guard. While they may be telling the truth, it could also be a tactic to gain our trust. Player4's revelation as the Seer and confirmation of Player2 as a villager gives us some solid ground to work from. I suggest we continue discussing and evaluating everyone's claims before making any votes. Let's work together to identify the real threats among us.
Player7(Villager): 21 | Listen everyone, I appreciate the discussions happening here. Player1's claim as the guard is crucial, but we must remain vigilant. Player4's confirmation of Player2 adds a layer of trust, but we still need to evaluate Player1's role carefully. I suggest we continue to share our observations and work together to identify any suspicious behavior. Let's keep our focus on the goal of eliminating the werewolves while ensuring we protect our own. I am here to support the team and will share my thoughts as we move forward.
