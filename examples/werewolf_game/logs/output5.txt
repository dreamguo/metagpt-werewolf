                   You only choose one from the following living options please: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'].

                   all of the 2 werewolves! Keep in mind you are teammates. The rest players are not werewolves.
                   choose one from the following living options please:
                   ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7']. For example: Kill ...
Player2(Werewolf): 6 | Hunt Player1

Moderator(Moderator): 10 | Witch, tonight Player1 has been killed by the werewolves.
                   You have a bottle of antidote, would you like to save him/her? If so, say "Save", else, say "Pass".
Player7(Witch): 10 | SAVE

                   If so, say ONLY "Poison PlayerX", replace PlayerX with the actual player name, else, say "Pass".
Player7(Witch): 12 | PASS
Moderator(Moderator): 13 | Understood
Moderator(Moderator): 14 | Witch, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 15 | Seer, please open your eyes!
Moderator(Moderator): 16 | Seer, you can check one player's identity. Who are you going to verify its identity tonight?
                    Choose only one from the following living options:['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'].
Player1(Seer): 16 | Verify Player2
Moderator(Moderator): 17 | Player2 is a werewolf
Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Seer): 21 | I will reveal my identity as the Seer and share that Player2 is a werewolf. I urge everyone to vote to eliminate Player2 to protect our village.
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | I believe Player1's claim as the Seer is questionable. They could be trying to eliminate me to protect their own position. I urge everyone to consider that Player1 might be misleading us. Let's focus on gathering more information before making any hasty decisions.
Player3(Villager): 21 | I believe we need to carefully consider the claims made by Player1 and Player2. Player1's assertion as the Seer could be a genuine attempt to protect the village, while Player2's defense seems overly defensive and could indicate they are hiding something. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and observations to ensure we make the best decision for our village. Let's not rush into voting without gathering more information.
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | I believe we should be cautious about Player1's claim as the Seer. While it could be genuine, we must consider that they might be trying to mislead us. Player2's defense is valid, and I urge everyone to think critically about the situation. Let's gather more information before jumping to conclusions. We should not rush into voting without a thorough discussion.
Player5(Villager): 21 | I believe we need to take a step back and analyze the situation carefully. Player1's claim as the Seer is significant, but we must consider the possibility of deception. Player2's defense is also noteworthy, as it could indicate they are trying to protect themselves. I urge everyone to share their observations and thoughts before we rush into a vote. Let's ensure we make an informed decision for the good of our village.
Player6(Guard): 21 | I believe we should take a step back and analyze the claims made by Player1 and Player2. Player1's assertion as the Seer is significant, but we must also consider the possibility of deception. Player2's defensive response raises some suspicion, but it could also be a natural reaction. I urge everyone to share their observations and thoughts before we rush into a vote. Let's ensure we make an informed decision for the good of our village.
Player7(Witch): 21 | I believe we should take a cautious approach. While Player1's claim as the Seer is significant, we must verify it before making any decisions. I urge everyone to discuss further and gather more information before voting. Let's not rush into eliminating anyone without sufficient evidence.

Moderator(Moderator): 23 | Now vote and tell me who you think is the werewolf. Donâ€™t mention your role.

                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Seer): 21 | I will reveal my identity as the Seer and share that Player2 is a werewolf. I urge everyone to vote to eliminate Player2 to protect our village.
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | I believe Player1's claim as the Seer is questionable. They could be trying to eliminate me to protect their own position. I urge everyone to consider that Player1 might be misleading us. Let's focus on gathering more information before making any hasty decisions.
Player3(Villager): 21 | I believe we need to carefully consider the claims made by Player1 and Player2. Player1's assertion as the Seer could be a genuine attempt to protect the village, while Player2's defense seems overly defensive and could indicate they are hiding something. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and observations to ensure we make the best decision for our village. Let's not rush into voting without gathering more information.
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | I believe we should be cautious about Player1's claim as the Seer. While it could be genuine, we must consider that they might be trying to mislead us. Player2's defense is valid, and I urge everyone to think critically about the situation. Let's gather more information before jumping to conclusions. We should not rush into voting without a thorough discussion.
Player5(Villager): 21 | I believe we need to take a step back and analyze the situation carefully. Player1's claim as the Seer is significant, but we must consider the possibility of deception. Player2's defense is also noteworthy, as it could indicate they are trying to protect themselves. I urge everyone to share their observations and thoughts before we rush into a vote. Let's ensure we make an informed decision for the good of our village.
Player6(Guard): 21 | I believe we should take a step back and analyze the claims made by Player1 and Player2. Player1's assertion as the Seer is significant, but we must also consider the possibility of deception. Player2's defensive response raises some suspicion, but it could also be a natural reaction. I urge everyone to share their observations and thoughts before we rush into a vote. Let's ensure we make an informed decision for the good of our village.
Player7(Witch): 21 | I believe we should take a cautious approach. While Player1's claim as the Seer is significant, we must verify it before making any decisions. I urge everyone to discuss further and gather more information before voting. Let's not rush into eliminating anyone without sufficient evidence.

Moderator(Moderator): 17 | Player2 is a werewolf
Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Seer): 21 | I will reveal my identity as the Seer and share that Player2 is a werewolf. I urge everyone to vote to eliminate Player2 to protect our village.
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | I believe Player1's claim as the Seer is questionable. They could be trying to eliminate me to protect their own position. I urge everyone to consider that Player1 might be misleading us. Let's focus on gathering more information before making any hasty decisions.
Player3(Villager): 21 | I believe we need to carefully consider the claims made by Player1 and Player2. Player1's assertion as the Seer could be a genuine attempt to protect the village, while Player2's defense seems overly defensive and could indicate they are hiding something. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and observations to ensure we make the best decision for our village. Let's not rush into voting without gathering more information.
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | I believe we should be cautious about Player1's claim as the Seer. While it could be genuine, we must consider that they might be trying to mislead us. Player2's defense is valid, and I urge everyone to think critically about the situation. Let's gather more information before jumping to conclusions. We should not rush into voting without a thorough discussion.
Player5(Villager): 21 | I believe we need to take a step back and analyze the situation carefully. Player1's claim as the Seer is significant, but we must consider the possibility of deception. Player2's defense is also noteworthy, as it could indicate they are trying to protect themselves. I urge everyone to share their observations and thoughts before we rush into a vote. Let's ensure we make an informed decision for the good of our village.
Player6(Guard): 21 | I believe we should take a step back and analyze the claims made by Player1 and Player2. Player1's assertion as the Seer is significant, but we must also consider the possibility of deception. Player2's defensive response raises some suspicion, but it could also be a natural reaction. I urge everyone to share their observations and thoughts before we rush into a vote. Let's ensure we make an informed decision for the good of our village.
Player7(Witch): 21 | I believe we should take a cautious approach. While Player1's claim as the Seer is significant, we must verify it before making any decisions. I urge everyone to discuss further and gather more information before voting. Let's not rush into eliminating anyone without sufficient evidence.
