Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7', 'Player8', 'Player9', 'Player10'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Seer): 21 | Yo, listen up fam! So, I got some intel from last night, and it’s wild. I checked Player3, and guess what? They’re a werewolf, straight up! We gotta keep our eyes peeled and work together to figure this out. I mean, we’ve got a solid crew of villagers here, and it’s time to take out the trash. Let’s not sleep on this, alright? I vote to eliminate Player3, no cap!
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | Ayo, real talk, Player1 is coming in hot with those accusations, but we gotta be cautious, fam. Like, what if they’re just trying to throw us off? I mean, Player3 is my dude, and I’m not about to let Player1 steer the ship. Let’s keep our heads in the game and not get played. I say we keep an eye on Player1, no cap. But for now, I’m not voting to eliminate anyone just yet. Let’s see how this plays out.
Player3(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, hold up, fam! Player1 is coming in real strong with those accusations, and honestly, it feels a bit sus, you know? Like, why are they so quick to point fingers without solid proof? I mean, real talk, we gotta be careful not to jump to conclusions here. Player2 is right; we should keep our eyes peeled and not let ourselves get played. I say we chill for a bit and see how the vibes shift before making any big moves. Let’s not rush into eliminating anyone just yet, fam.
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, real talk, I feel like Player1 is coming in way too strong with those accusations against Player3. Like, it’s almost like they’re trying to stir the pot, you know? I mean, Player3 is just trying to chill and not get caught up in this drama. Tbh, we gotta watch Player1 too, fam. They could be trying to play us all. Let’s keep our heads on straight and not rush into any votes just yet. I say we take a step back and see how this plays out before making any big moves. For now, I’m not voting to eliminate anyone, just keeping it real.
Player5(Guard): 21 | Yo, real talk, this situation is heating up. Player1 is coming in hot with those accusations against Player3, and honestly, it feels a bit off. Like, why are they so quick to point fingers without solid proof? Player2 and Player4 are backing Player3, which makes me think we should be cautious about jumping to conclusions. I’m not ready to vote anyone out just yet, but I’m definitely keeping my eyes on Player1. We gotta keep the vibes right and not let ourselves get played. Let’s chill for a bit and see how this unfolds before making any big moves.
Player6(Werewolf): 21 | Ayo, listen up! Player1 is coming in way too hot with those accusations, and it’s raising some serious red flags, you feel me? Like, why the rush to point fingers without solid proof? I mean, real talk, we gotta be careful not to get played here. Player3 is just trying to chill, and Player1's energy feels off. I say we keep our eyes on Player1 and not make any hasty moves just yet. Let’s vibe a bit longer before we start eliminating folks. Just saying, fam, let’s play it smart.
Player7(Villager): 21 | I vote to eliminate Player1

Moderator(Moderator): 14 | Witch, close your eyes

Moderator(Moderator): 16 | Seer, you can check one player's identity. Who are you going to verify its identity tonight?
                    Choose only one from the following living options:['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7', 'Player8', 'Player9', 'Player10'].
Player1(Seer): 16 | Verify Player3
Moderator(Moderator): 17 | Player3 is a werewolf
Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7', 'Player8', 'Player9', 'Player10'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Seer): 21 | Yo, listen up fam! So, I got some intel from last night, and it’s wild. I checked Player3, and guess what? They’re a werewolf, straight up! We gotta keep our eyes peeled and work together to figure this out. I mean, we’ve got a solid crew of villagers here, and it’s time to take out the trash. Let’s not sleep on this, alright? I vote to eliminate Player3, no cap!
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | Ayo, real talk, Player1 is coming in hot with those accusations, but we gotta be cautious, fam. Like, what if they’re just trying to throw us off? I mean, Player3 is my dude, and I’m not about to let Player1 steer the ship. Let’s keep our heads in the game and not get played. I say we keep an eye on Player1, no cap. But for now, I’m not voting to eliminate anyone just yet. Let’s see how this plays out.
Player3(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, hold up, fam! Player1 is coming in real strong with those accusations, and honestly, it feels a bit sus, you know? Like, why are they so quick to point fingers without solid proof? I mean, real talk, we gotta be careful not to jump to conclusions here. Player2 is right; we should keep our eyes peeled and not let ourselves get played. I say we chill for a bit and see how the vibes shift before making any big moves. Let’s not rush into eliminating anyone just yet, fam.
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, real talk, I feel like Player1 is coming in way too strong with those accusations against Player3. Like, it’s almost like they’re trying to stir the pot, you know? I mean, Player3 is just trying to chill and not get caught up in this drama. Tbh, we gotta watch Player1 too, fam. They could be trying to play us all. Let’s keep our heads on straight and not rush into any votes just yet. I say we take a step back and see how this plays out before making any big moves. For now, I’m not voting to eliminate anyone, just keeping it real.
Player5(Guard): 21 | Yo, real talk, this situation is heating up. Player1 is coming in hot with those accusations against Player3, and honestly, it feels a bit off. Like, why are they so quick to point fingers without solid proof? Player2 and Player4 are backing Player3, which makes me think we should be cautious about jumping to conclusions. I’m not ready to vote anyone out just yet, but I’m definitely keeping my eyes on Player1. We gotta keep the vibes right and not let ourselves get played. Let’s chill for a bit and see how this unfolds before making any big moves.
Player6(Werewolf): 21 | Ayo, listen up! Player1 is coming in way too hot with those accusations, and it’s raising some serious red flags, you feel me? Like, why the rush to point fingers without solid proof? I mean, real talk, we gotta be careful not to get played here. Player3 is just trying to chill, and Player1's energy feels off. I say we keep our eyes on Player1 and not make any hasty moves just yet. Let’s vibe a bit longer before we start eliminating folks. Just saying, fam, let’s play it smart.
Player7(Villager): 21 | I vote to eliminate Player1

Player1(Seer): 21 | Yo, listen up fam! So, I got some intel from last night, and it’s wild. I checked Player3, and guess what? They’re a werewolf, straight up! We gotta keep our eyes peeled and work together to figure this out. I mean, we’ve got a solid crew of villagers here, and it’s time to take out the trash. Let’s not sleep on this, alright? I vote to eliminate Player3, no cap!
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | Ayo, real talk, Player1 is coming in hot with those accusations, but we gotta be cautious, fam. Like, what if they’re just trying to throw us off? I mean, Player3 is my dude, and I’m not about to let Player1 steer the ship. Let’s keep our heads in the game and not get played. I say we keep an eye on Player1, no cap. But for now, I’m not voting to eliminate anyone just yet. Let’s see how this plays out.
Player3(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, hold up, fam! Player1 is coming in real strong with those accusations, and honestly, it feels a bit sus, you know? Like, why are they so quick to point fingers without solid proof? I mean, real talk, we gotta be careful not to jump to conclusions here. Player2 is right; we should keep our eyes peeled and not let ourselves get played. I say we chill for a bit and see how the vibes shift before making any big moves. Let’s not rush into eliminating anyone just yet, fam.
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, real talk, I feel like Player1 is coming in way too strong with those accusations against Player3. Like, it’s almost like they’re trying to stir the pot, you know? I mean, Player3 is just trying to chill and not get caught up in this drama. Tbh, we gotta watch Player1 too, fam. They could be trying to play us all. Let’s keep our heads on straight and not rush into any votes just yet. I say we take a step back and see how this plays out before making any big moves. For now, I’m not voting to eliminate anyone, just keeping it real.
Player5(Guard): 21 | Yo, real talk, this situation is heating up. Player1 is coming in hot with those accusations against Player3, and honestly, it feels a bit off. Like, why are they so quick to point fingers without solid proof? Player2 and Player4 are backing Player3, which makes me think we should be cautious about jumping to conclusions. I’m not ready to vote anyone out just yet, but I’m definitely keeping my eyes on Player1. We gotta keep the vibes right and not let ourselves get played. Let’s chill for a bit and see how this unfolds before making any big moves.
Player6(Werewolf): 21 | Ayo, listen up! Player1 is coming in way too hot with those accusations, and it’s raising some serious red flags, you feel me? Like, why the rush to point fingers without solid proof? I mean, real talk, we gotta be careful not to get played here. Player3 is just trying to chill, and Player1's energy feels off. I say we keep our eyes on Player1 and not make any hasty moves just yet. Let’s vibe a bit longer before we start eliminating folks. Just saying, fam, let’s play it smart.
