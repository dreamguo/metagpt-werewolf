                   choose one from the following living options please:
                   ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6']. For example: Kill ...

Moderator(Moderator): 14 | Witch, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 15 | Seer, please open your eyes!
Moderator(Moderator): 16 | Seer, you can check one player's identity. Who are you going to verify its identity tonight?
                    Choose only one from the following living options:['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6'].
Player2(Seer): 16 | Verify Player1
Moderator(Moderator): 17 | Player1 is a werewolf
Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, so like, weâ€™re all still here, right? No one got taken out, which is kinda wild. I mean, Iâ€™m just a villager chilling, but I gotta say, Iâ€™m keeping an eye on Player2 and Player3. They seem a bit too quiet, you know? Like, real talk, we gotta figure out whoâ€™s sus before itâ€™s too late. Letâ€™s keep the convo going, fam!
Player2(Seer): 21 | Alright, fam, listen up! I gotta drop some real info here. Iâ€™m the Seer, and I verified Player1 last night â€“ theyâ€™re a werewolf, no cap. We gotta focus on getting rid of that threat before they take us out one by one. I know itâ€™s risky to reveal my role, but we need to strategize and work together. Player1 is sus as hell, and we canâ€™t let them slide. Letâ€™s keep the convo going and make sure weâ€™re all on the same page. Time to eliminate the real danger here!
Player3(Witch): 21 | Alright, fam, letâ€™s break this down. Player2 is throwing some serious shade at Player1, claiming theyâ€™re a werewolf. But like, we gotta be careful here, right? Player2 could be playing us, trying to get rid of a villager. Iâ€™m not ready to reveal my role just yet, but Iâ€™m watching both of them closely. We need to keep the convo flowing and figure out whoâ€™s really sus. Letâ€™s keep our heads in the game and not jump to conclusions. For real, we gotta strategize before making any moves.
Player4(Guard): 21 | Alright, fam, hereâ€™s the deal. Weâ€™re in a tight spot with Player2 calling out Player1, but we gotta be careful not to jump the gun. Player3 is playing it smart, and honestly, Iâ€™m feeling like we need to keep the pressure on Player1 for now. Iâ€™m not ready to reveal my role just yet, but Iâ€™m keeping my eyes peeled. Letâ€™s keep the convo going and figure out our next move before we make any wild decisions. For real, we gotta strategize and not let the werewolves get the upper hand.
Player5(Werewolf): 21 | Alright, listen up, fam. So, Player2 is throwing some serious claims out here, saying theyâ€™re the Seer and calling out Player1. But like, real talk, we gotta be cautious. What if Player2 is just trying to frame Player1 to get rid of a threat? I mean, itâ€™s a risky move, and we canâ€™t just take their word for it. Player3 is right to be skeptical, and honestly, we should keep our options open. Letâ€™s not jump to conclusions just yet. Iâ€™m keeping my eyes on Player2 for now. We need to strategize and not let anyone play us. Stay sharp, everyone!
Player6(Villager): 21 | Yo, fam, we gotta keep it real here. Player2's throwing some heavy claims about Player1 being a werewolf, and thatâ€™s wild. But like, we can't just take that at face value, right? Player3 and Player5 are being smart, keeping their options open, and Iâ€™m with them on that. Iâ€™m just a villager, no special role to reveal, but Iâ€™m watching Player2 closely. If theyâ€™re legit, we need to back them up, but if theyâ€™re playing us, we gotta be ready to pivot. Letâ€™s keep the convo going and figure out whoâ€™s really sus before we make any moves. Stay sharp, everyone!

                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, so like, weâ€™re all still here, right? No one got taken out, which is kinda wild. I mean, Iâ€™m just a villager chilling, but I gotta say, Iâ€™m keeping an eye on Player2 and Player3. They seem a bit too quiet, you know? Like, real talk, we gotta figure out whoâ€™s sus before itâ€™s too late. Letâ€™s keep the convo going, fam!
Player2(Seer): 21 | Alright, fam, listen up! I gotta drop some real info here. Iâ€™m the Seer, and I verified Player1 last night â€“ theyâ€™re a werewolf, no cap. We gotta focus on getting rid of that threat before they take us out one by one. I know itâ€™s risky to reveal my role, but we need to strategize and work together. Player1 is sus as hell, and we canâ€™t let them slide. Letâ€™s keep the convo going and make sure weâ€™re all on the same page. Time to eliminate the real danger here!
Player3(Witch): 21 | Alright, fam, letâ€™s break this down. Player2 is throwing some serious shade at Player1, claiming theyâ€™re a werewolf. But like, we gotta be careful here, right? Player2 could be playing us, trying to get rid of a villager. Iâ€™m not ready to reveal my role just yet, but Iâ€™m watching both of them closely. We need to keep the convo flowing and figure out whoâ€™s really sus. Letâ€™s keep our heads in the game and not jump to conclusions. For real, we gotta strategize before making any moves.
Player4(Guard): 21 | Alright, fam, hereâ€™s the deal. Weâ€™re in a tight spot with Player2 calling out Player1, but we gotta be careful not to jump the gun. Player3 is playing it smart, and honestly, Iâ€™m feeling like we need to keep the pressure on Player1 for now. Iâ€™m not ready to reveal my role just yet, but Iâ€™m keeping my eyes peeled. Letâ€™s keep the convo going and figure out our next move before we make any wild decisions. For real, we gotta strategize and not let the werewolves get the upper hand.
Player5(Werewolf): 21 | Alright, listen up, fam. So, Player2 is throwing some serious claims out here, saying theyâ€™re the Seer and calling out Player1. But like, real talk, we gotta be cautious. What if Player2 is just trying to frame Player1 to get rid of a threat? I mean, itâ€™s a risky move, and we canâ€™t just take their word for it. Player3 is right to be skeptical, and honestly, we should keep our options open. Letâ€™s not jump to conclusions just yet. Iâ€™m keeping my eyes on Player2 for now. We need to strategize and not let anyone play us. Stay sharp, everyone!
Player6(Villager): 21 | Yo, fam, we gotta keep it real here. Player2's throwing some heavy claims about Player1 being a werewolf, and thatâ€™s wild. But like, we can't just take that at face value, right? Player3 and Player5 are being smart, keeping their options open, and Iâ€™m with them on that. Iâ€™m just a villager, no special role to reveal, but Iâ€™m watching Player2 closely. If theyâ€™re legit, we need to back them up, but if theyâ€™re playing us, we gotta be ready to pivot. Letâ€™s keep the convo going and figure out whoâ€™s really sus before we make any moves. Stay sharp, everyone!

Player3(Witch): 47 | Alright, fam, letâ€™s keep it 100 here. Weâ€™ve lost Player1, who was a werewolf, and Player2 was a villager, which means weâ€™re down to just us three villagers and me, the Witch. Iâ€™m feeling like Player4 is kinda quiet, and thatâ€™s a bit sus. Player5 and Player6 seem to be on the same page, but we gotta keep our eyes peeled. Iâ€™m not ready to reveal my role just yet, but I think we need to focus on Player4 for now. Letâ€™s keep the convo going and figure out our next move. I vote to eliminate Player4.
Player4(Guard): 47 | I vote to eliminate Player4.
Player5(Werewolf): 47 | Yo, real talk, we gotta keep our heads in the game. Player4â€™s been kinda low-key, and thatâ€™s raising some red flags for me. I mean, Player3 is claiming to be the Witch and seems to have a plan, but Player4 not saying much is sus. Letâ€™s keep the convo flowing and figure out our next move. I vote to eliminate Player4.

Player2(Seer): 16 | Verify Player1
Moderator(Moderator): 17 | Player1 is a werewolf
Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Werewolf): 21 | Yo, so like, weâ€™re all still here, right? No one got taken out, which is kinda wild. I mean, Iâ€™m just a villager chilling, but I gotta say, Iâ€™m keeping an eye on Player2 and Player3. They seem a bit too quiet, you know? Like, real talk, we gotta figure out whoâ€™s sus before itâ€™s too late. Letâ€™s keep the convo going, fam!
Player2(Seer): 21 | Alright, fam, listen up! I gotta drop some real info here. Iâ€™m the Seer, and I verified Player1 last night â€“ theyâ€™re a werewolf, no cap. We gotta focus on getting rid of that threat before they take us out one by one. I know itâ€™s risky to reveal my role, but we need to strategize and work together. Player1 is sus as hell, and we canâ€™t let them slide. Letâ€™s keep the convo going and make sure weâ€™re all on the same page. Time to eliminate the real danger here!
Player3(Witch): 21 | Alright, fam, letâ€™s break this down. Player2 is throwing some serious shade at Player1, claiming theyâ€™re a werewolf. But like, we gotta be careful here, right? Player2 could be playing us, trying to get rid of a villager. Iâ€™m not ready to reveal my role just yet, but Iâ€™m watching both of them closely. We need to keep the convo flowing and figure out whoâ€™s really sus. Letâ€™s keep our heads in the game and not jump to conclusions. For real, we gotta strategize before making any moves.
Player4(Guard): 21 | Alright, fam, hereâ€™s the deal. Weâ€™re in a tight spot with Player2 calling out Player1, but we gotta be careful not to jump the gun. Player3 is playing it smart, and honestly, Iâ€™m feeling like we need to keep the pressure on Player1 for now. Iâ€™m not ready to reveal my role just yet, but Iâ€™m keeping my eyes peeled. Letâ€™s keep the convo going and figure out our next move before we make any wild decisions. For real, we gotta strategize and not let the werewolves get the upper hand.
Player5(Werewolf): 21 | Alright, listen up, fam. So, Player2 is throwing some serious claims out here, saying theyâ€™re the Seer and calling out Player1. But like, real talk, we gotta be cautious. What if Player2 is just trying to frame Player1 to get rid of a threat? I mean, itâ€™s a risky move, and we canâ€™t just take their word for it. Player3 is right to be skeptical, and honestly, we should keep our options open. Letâ€™s not jump to conclusions just yet. Iâ€™m keeping my eyes on Player2 for now. We need to strategize and not let anyone play us. Stay sharp, everyone!
Player6(Villager): 21 | Yo, fam, we gotta keep it real here. Player2's throwing some heavy claims about Player1 being a werewolf, and thatâ€™s wild. But like, we can't just take that at face value, right? Player3 and Player5 are being smart, keeping their options open, and Iâ€™m with them on that. Iâ€™m just a villager, no special role to reveal, but Iâ€™m watching Player2 closely. If theyâ€™re legit, we need to back them up, but if theyâ€™re playing us, we gotta be ready to pivot. Letâ€™s keep the convo going and figure out whoâ€™s really sus before we make any moves. Stay sharp, everyone!
