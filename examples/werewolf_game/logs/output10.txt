                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Seer): 21 | I believe it's crucial to share my identity as the Seer to gain trust and encourage open discussion. I confirm that Player2 is a villager. I urge everyone to share their roles and observations to help identify the werewolves among us.
Player2(Guard): 21 | I believe Player1's claim as the Seer is trustworthy, and I urge everyone to share their roles. This will help us identify the werewolves among us. I will hold off on revealing my identity as the Guard for now, as it may put me at risk.
Player3(Villager): 21 | I believe we should continue discussing and sharing our observations. Player1's claim as the Seer is crucial, and I encourage everyone to share their roles to help identify the werewolves. I will hold off on revealing my identity for now, as it may not be beneficial at this stage.
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | I believe Player1's claim as the Seer is suspicious. We should be cautious about trusting them completely. I vote to eliminate Player1.
Player5(Villager): 21 | I support Player1's claim as the Seer and urge everyone to share their roles. We need to work together to identify the werewolves among us.
Player6(Werewolf): 21 | I believe Player1's claim as the Seer is highly suspicious. We should be cautious about trusting them completely and consider the possibility that they might be misleading us. I vote to eliminate Player1.
Player7(Witch): 21 | I believe Player1's claim as the Seer is crucial for our strategy. I urge everyone to share their roles and observations to help identify the werewolves among us. We need to work together and be cautious of those who are sowing doubt, like Player4 and Player6. Let's focus on collaboration to ensure we eliminate the true threats.

Moderator(Moderator): 14 | Witch, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 15 | Seer, please open your eyes!
Moderator(Moderator): 16 | Seer, you can check one player's identity. Who are you going to verify its identity tonight?
                    Choose only one from the following living options:['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'].
Player1(Seer): 16 | Verify Player2
Moderator(Moderator): 17 | Player2 is a good guy
Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | No one was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player1', 'Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player1(Seer): 21 | I believe it's crucial to share my identity as the Seer to gain trust and encourage open discussion. I confirm that Player2 is a villager. I urge everyone to share their roles and observations to help identify the werewolves among us.
Player2(Guard): 21 | I believe Player1's claim as the Seer is trustworthy, and I urge everyone to share their roles. This will help us identify the werewolves among us. I will hold off on revealing my identity as the Guard for now, as it may put me at risk.
Player3(Villager): 21 | I believe we should continue discussing and sharing our observations. Player1's claim as the Seer is crucial, and I encourage everyone to share their roles to help identify the werewolves. I will hold off on revealing my identity for now, as it may not be beneficial at this stage.
Player4(Werewolf): 21 | I believe Player1's claim as the Seer is suspicious. We should be cautious about trusting them completely. I vote to eliminate Player1.
Player5(Villager): 21 | I support Player1's claim as the Seer and urge everyone to share their roles. We need to work together to identify the werewolves among us.
Player6(Werewolf): 21 | I believe Player1's claim as the Seer is highly suspicious. We should be cautious about trusting them completely and consider the possibility that they might be misleading us. I vote to eliminate Player1.
Player7(Witch): 21 | I believe Player1's claim as the Seer is crucial for our strategy. I urge everyone to share their roles and observations to help identify the werewolves among us. We need to work together and be cautious of those who are sowing doubt, like Player4 and Player6. Let's focus on collaboration to ensure we eliminate the true threats.
