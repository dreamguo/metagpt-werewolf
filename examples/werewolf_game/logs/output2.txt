Moderator(Moderator): 17 | Player1 is a good guy
Moderator(Moderator): 18 | Seer, close your eyes
Moderator(Moderator): 19 | It's daytime. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.
Moderator(Moderator): 20 | ['Player1'] was killed last night!
Moderator(Moderator): 21 | Living players: ['Player2', 'Player3', 'Player4', 'Player5', 'Player6', 'Player7'], now freely talk about the current situation based on your observation and
                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | I think we should be cautious about who we trust. Player1's death is concerning, and we need to analyze the remaining players closely. I haven't seen any claims from Player3, Player4, Player5, or Player6, which makes me wonder about their intentions. We should consider investigating their actions more closely before making any decisions. Let's discuss who we think might be the next target or who seems suspicious.
Player3(Seer): 21 | I believe it is crucial for me to reveal my identity as the Seer. I verified Player1 as a good guy, and their death suggests we need to be vigilant. Player2 seems trustworthy, but we should scrutinize the others. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and observations to identify suspicious behavior.
Player4(Villager): 21 | I believe we should focus on the players who have not made any claims. Player5, Player6, and Player7 have been silent, which raises suspicion. I urge everyone to share their observations. Let's analyze their behavior closely to identify the werewolves among us.
Player5(Guard): 21 | I believe we should focus on the silent players, particularly Player6 and Player7, as they have not contributed to the discussion. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and observations to identify suspicious behavior. Let's analyze the situation closely before making any decisions.
Player6(Witch): 21 | I believe it's important to share my identity as the Witch. I have the ability to save or eliminate players, and I want to ensure we are working together to identify the werewolves. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and observations so we can make informed decisions. Player7's silence is concerning, and I suggest we keep a close eye on them.
Player7(Werewolf): 21 | I believe we should be cautious about Player3's claim as the Seer. While they say they verified Player1 as a villager, we need to consider the possibility that they could be misleading us. Player4 and Player5 are right to focus on the silent players, but we should also scrutinize Player3's actions closely. Let's not forget that Player6 has claimed to be the Witch and could play a significant role in our decisions moving forward. We need to work together to identify the true threats among us.

                    reflection with a few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.
Player2(Werewolf): 21 | I think we should be cautious about who we trust. Player1's death is concerning, and we need to analyze the remaining players closely. I haven't seen any claims from Player3, Player4, Player5, or Player6, which makes me wonder about their intentions. We should consider investigating their actions more closely before making any decisions. Let's discuss who we think might be the next target or who seems suspicious.
Player3(Seer): 21 | I believe it is crucial for me to reveal my identity as the Seer. I verified Player1 as a good guy, and their death suggests we need to be vigilant. Player2 seems trustworthy, but we should scrutinize the others. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and observations to identify suspicious behavior.
Player4(Villager): 21 | I believe we should focus on the players who have not made any claims. Player5, Player6, and Player7 have been silent, which raises suspicion. I urge everyone to share their observations. Let's analyze their behavior closely to identify the werewolves among us.
Player5(Guard): 21 | I believe we should focus on the silent players, particularly Player6 and Player7, as they have not contributed to the discussion. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and observations to identify suspicious behavior. Let's analyze the situation closely before making any decisions.
Player6(Witch): 21 | I believe it's important to share my identity as the Witch. I have the ability to save or eliminate players, and I want to ensure we are working together to identify the werewolves. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and observations so we can make informed decisions. Player7's silence is concerning, and I suggest we keep a close eye on them.
Player7(Werewolf): 21 | I believe we should be cautious about Player3's claim as the Seer. While they say they verified Player1 as a villager, we need to consider the possibility that they could be misleading us. Player4 and Player5 are right to focus on the silent players, but we should also scrutinize Player3's actions closely. Let's not forget that Player6 has claimed to be the Witch and could play a significant role in our decisions moving forward. We need to work together to identify the true threats among us.
